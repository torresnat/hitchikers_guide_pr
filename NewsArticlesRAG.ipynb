MORNING THE MORNING THE FIRST AND ONLY NEWSPAPER IN PUERTO RICO WITH ABC-CERTIFIED CIRCULATION. YEAR XXX 1 as second class matter, Office, flan Juan, F. R. Entered Post  SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - SATURDAY, MARCH 11, 1950 NUMBER 13956 FIVE CENT AFF Raises Rural Area Problem Needs Grant From Lucchetti Explains Plan For Neighborhoods Will Require 2,500,000 Contribution r burioo i, rivera Reactor da EL MUNDO . -Puerto Ricos rural electrification is a cyclopean work of great social value, but its development is subject to the help that Jos. taxpayers can contribute, since it is an undertaking that requires a subsidy to be carried out in its entirety. In such terms was expressed by senior Antonio Lucchetti, executive director of the Water Resources Authority, when this editor asked him about the Jalas rural electrification program. The construction of extensions in rural areas, he says, is something that is very expensive; it is not self-fundable, it cannot be produced, and it has to be done on a subsidy basis with the help of the contributors. Mr. Lucchetti adds that the Water Resources Authority is taking a great rosponaablllllity in taking over the cost of the operation of this system. This program is limited to the funds available for its implementation. This year only 1300,000 has been recommended; previously it spoke of an allocation of 9400,000. River Sources, Mr. Lucchetti continued, since it made the recommendations to initiate the construction of lines in the rural area, which was done with the help of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration in 1938, has always maintained a vigorous struggle to speed up the expansion of the electric system so that as soon as possible electricity can be supplied to all the inhabitants of Puerto Rico in whatever part of the country they may be, including the rural area. Explained my advance the sophor Lucchetti that in the realization of this proposal, it has always encountered the lack of funds to attack it properly. However, when the opportunity has presented itself, Fuentes Fluviales has taken advantage of it and the progress it has made so far is the maximum progress that has allowed the advancement of Puerto Ricos economy. He points out advantages However, despite the difficulty in developing the rural electrification program on the island, Mr. Lucchetti points out some of the advantages of the program. He says Everything that is fought for in the world, progress, satisfaction and tranquility in the soul, is a principle of political economy. It produces a very salutary effect on people. It fosters the spirit of association. The above philosophical principle is achieved, as Mr. Lucchetti let it be understood, through the facilities that man has in enjoying a full service of occlusion. On the other hand, and in a more or less general sense, the rural electrification program compensates somewhat for the subsidy that may be allocated for its implementation, At present, for every dollar obtained from the sale of electric energy in the rural area, only one cent goes to the municipality where it is sold. Another five cents goes into the Island Treasury. In such form and manner, it could be said that for every 9100,000 that is allocated for this program, about fifteen to twenty thousand dollars would be obtained from the sale of energy and of that amount, one thousand dollars would return to the Island Treasury. It is therefore an investment that yields the Government a 3-1J2 percent profit. Program Completed The rural oil projects completed in the first year of the program, corresponding to fiscal year 1949-47, cost approximately 9,400,839.54. A total of 717,714 primary and secondary lines were extended to serve some 8,118 subscribers. For the second year of the program, 1847-48, 9401,834.40 was spent on 780,138 feet of primary and secondary lines serving 3,903 subscribers. The third phase, 194849, cost 8401,888.89; 747,893 feet of primary and secondary lines serving 9,748 subscribers. In all, 81,849.90 was spent on the three major parts of the program, for some 3,315,773 feet of primary and secondary lines serving some 8,785 subscribers of the River Basin Authority. Fourth Program Program The final report that the A. F. F. F. on the rural electrification program states the following in connection with the program to be carried out for the fourth year of the general program 1949-50 and for the fourth year 1950-51. The report states A total of 33 projects, amounting to the estimated amount of 8,400,318.87, were approved for execution during the fourth year of the program and for the fourth year of the general program 1949-50.

Many are already sick to their stomachs. The Association of Parents and Teachers of the locality has addressed the Commissioner of Instruction, Mariano Villaronga, to inform him about the matter and to point out the serious risk to the health of the community in general. The complainants allege that the only source of water for school children is the spring well, whose water is contaminated, according to medical certification. An official from the Public Health Department in Moca took samples of the water, which were analyzed in Aguadilla. Officer Julio Alvaros and Dr. A. Pintado authorized a sample of the water, which was analyzed in Aguadilla. tlflcado in possession of the plaintiffs, stating that the referred waters are contaminated. Health Threatened Cuchillas schools are attended daily by 350 children. Two additional classrooms are being built, which will accommodate an additional 100 children. Moca parents allege that drinking such water seriously threatens the health of their children and that it could cause the spread of any disease to their children, and perhaps cause deaths. In fact, they report, numerous children have revealed a strange stomach ailment, thus causing uneasiness among teachers and parents.

Speaker Celestino Irlarte opposed the approval of this bill, considering that it would legalize an irregularity allowed by the Auditor of Puerto Rico, by approving that the Transportation Authority use an amount of money from its operating funds for the purchase of land, in order to exchange it with other land belonging to the Navy, an operation contrary to the provisions of the Law. Discretion in Bonds Senate Bills 101, 103 and 103 were approved to amend the Act providing for the provision of official bonds by the clerks and marshals of the Municipal Courts, leaving the setting of such bonds to the discretion of the Treasurer of Puerto Rico, with the approval of the Auditor.

By JamssF. Cunningham WASHINGTON, March 10 PU-Ox Gov. Jesus T. Uñero spent the morning on the island of Hawaii, March 10, 2010. Uñero spent the morning with Governor Luis Muñoz Marlp, giving a briefing on the ten thousand Puerto Ricans residing in the territory of Hawaii. Piflero has just returned from Honolulu, where he was Governor Muñoz Marins personal representative at the Golden Jubilee of Puerto Rican Immigrants. In general, Piflero reported, Puerto Ricans and their descendants in Hawaii are better integrated into the community than Puerto Ricans in New York and elsewhere on the Mainland, where they make up such a large percentage of the population. The Puerto Ricans in Hawaii have their own elvea, associations and athletic clubs, but they have blended into Hawaiis cosmopolitan society, and are more aware of their American citizenship than their compatriots in Puerto Rico, and even in New York. Puerto Ricans in Hawaii, Piflero said, have no inferiority complex about their citizenship - as is so often the case in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Ricans in Hawaii, he continued, occasionally refer to themselves as Puerto Ricans, but their great political interest is in the statehood of Hawaii. Although they rejoice in the progress and political developments on the Island, they are too deeply rooted in the Paradise Pad Continued on page 18, Col. 8. Editorial On Hedionda Sparks Debate In House Legislative Body Says It Has Not Yet Adopted Agreement On Its Use As Coffee Substitute An editorial by EL MUNDO sparked a debate in the session held by the House of Representatives yesterday. Representative Luis Santaliz Capestany addressed  the House, referring to the editorial published by EL MUNDO in its yesterdays edi- ción of yesterday, in relation to the possible use of stink as a coffee substitute. Santaliz expressed that the editorial was not in line with the agreement adopted by the Chamber and to that effect made a motion that the legislative body make a statement to the effect that it was not looking for coffee substitutes. Floor leader Benjamin Ortiz objected to the terms of the motion, citing procedural issues based mainly on the absence of the motions author, although he expressed sympathy with the San Tolls proposal. Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa In. tervlno stated that the editorial in EL MUNDO did not involve any malicious intent. He said that it was anti-scientific to make a pronouncement in the sense that no substitutes should be sought for coffee, since the search for substitutes has been felt as a necessity. He used medicine as an example and ended up by referring to people as the subject subject to the application of their. Figueroa said that if there is a production deficit of 100,000 tons of coffee on the island, there is nothing wrong in thinking of looking for substitutes to the grain and arguing in favor of the same, especially in the way this newspaper has done. Finally, Dr. Figueroa said that if there was any error, it might have arisen from the information originally published, and that it was feasible to rectify it, although he could not know either.

Gil charged him with an alleged violation of the Income Tax Law. For his part, Dr. Franceschi declared that in this case, he has been treated as a gangitor. The accusation alleges that Dr. Franceschi violated the aforementioned law by reporting in the tax return corresponding to fiscal year 1948 that his income was 934,980 when his real income was 957,537.30. It is also alleged in the indictment that Dr. Franceschi paid 9883.83 for his income for fiscal year 1948, when he should have paid 914,880. According to  Gil, the case of Dr. Franceschi is the first of its kind to be initiated in Puerto Rico against a citizen who declares income greater than that actually obtained.

The order was issued as a result of a stipulation filed in court by the claimant workers and the Zogri trustee. As you are aware, the American Railroad and the Puerto Rico Railroad Company filed a bankruptcy petition in Federal Court some time ago, as a result of the claim for unpaid minimum wages and overtime, which amounted to more than 3 million. A reorganization plan was then submitted to the Court, approved by the Court and is in the process of being put into full effect. Under the plan, a company composed of stockholders who are members of the United Railwaymens Union will inherit a portion of the railroads property and will continue to operate the railroad. The workers claim against the railroad company was settled for a total of 8,900,000, which was accepted by the Corto. David Chévez, Jr., ordered the trustee to pay the workers the sum of 8754,538.33. Of this amount, I will pay the sum of 8358,011 to the Compaflla de Trono-  porto Ferroviario do Puerto Rico, a corporation to be organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, for the purpose of acquiring porto do lar properties and continuing to operate the railroad, pursuant to an agreement with the Puerto Rico Transportation Authority.

Warning against the practice of keeping students more than two years in the same grade, which is prohibited, the Acting Commissioner of Instruction, Mr. Francisco Collazo, yesterday addressed the following communication to the superintendents of schools According to the reports on promotions, students are being kept more than two years in the same grade in elementary school. Circular Letter number 83 of April 27, 1934, prohibits such a termination, basing it on the pedagogical reason that no matter how little a student learns in the grade to which he is promoted, he will always learn more than when retained in the same grade for a third year. This statement has not been reversed at any time. On page 85 of the Annual Report of the Board of Education, for the year 194M9, there are 790 students from the urban area and 1,901 from the rural area promoted as having learned more than two years in the same grade.

Speculation, Rumors Raise Coffee Prices, Claim Speculation, Rumors Raise Coffee Prices WASHINGTON, March 10. PU - A South American told Congress yesterday that South American countries were offended and insulted by accusations by the United States that it had withheld coffee supplies to raise the price of coffee. Andres Urlbe, Acting President of the Pan American Coffee Bureau, told a Senate agriculture subcommittee that coffee prices are still too low. If American workers enjoyed the same living standards as North American workers, he said, it would cost 98 times as much to produce a pound of coffee. The aubcommittee, headed by Senator Guy M. Gillette, Democrat of Iowa, is investigating the sharp rise in coffee prices, which began in the fall. Earlier witnesses have alleged that the South American coffee producers coffee producers have forced a price hike as stocks of the product were reduced during a period of rising demand. More Coffee Shipments Urlbe countered that the opposite is true-- the poor coffee producers have shipped more coffee to the United States than ever before. The Latin Americans, he said, are offended that their national integrity has been challenged by accusations of cheating and defrauding the American consumer, and by engaging in plots and machinations. What actually drove up the price of coffee, he said, was fear-mongering by U.S. importers and speculators who heard rumors of drought and shortages in the producing countries.\n",

The Assembly so agreed, and went on to discuss the ordinance, with several of the Assembly members taking part in the debates. Finally, the part of the ordinance was repealed which provided that the litigating merchants act in furtherance of the wishes and directions of the business community who feel the necessity of obtaining a judicial interpretation of the challenged law; and be it finally RESOLVED, that the Chamber of Commerce hereby gives its endorsement and approval to the necessary steps on the part of the litigating merchants to achieve the end indicated and promises to lend them its enthusiastic and determined moral support. The new rice contract was brought up for discussion, at the request of the Millers Association.

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - SATURDAY MAY 27, 1950 NUMBER 14031 FIVE CENTAVOS Dismissal For Violence Justified Striker Should Not Destroy, Threaten, National Labor Board Rules In Container Case WASHINGTON, May 26. Special to EL MUNDO - The National Labor Relations Board ruled unanimously today that the Porto Rico Container Corporation, of Hato Rey, acted within the Taft Hartley Act in dismissing eighteen strikers who engaged in various acts of violence, threats of force against non-strikers, and destruction of company property. However, the Board majority decided that the same employer did not violate the Taft Hartley Act by deducting from the strikers last pay envelope the amounts they owed on loans they had received, while allowing the non-strikers to continue to gradually repay the loans they owed. The decisions were made in the case of the Container Corporation and the Unión do Operarlos de la Fábrica de Envases de Cartón, affiliated with the Confederación General de Trabajadores de Puerto Rico. The Board decided that the breakup illegally discharged six of twenty-four strikers, but held that the discharge of the other eighteen was within the law because, during the 1947 strike at the companys plant, they engaged in acts which exceeded permissible limits. The conduct on the part of the striking diehards, which the Board unanimously found to warrant dismissal, included 1. Malicious destruction of a padlock on the front gate of the company. 2. - 9. Slapping of a supervisor who was advising the strikers not to interfere with the padlocks on the companys gate. Other Rosones 8. Strikers, armed with clubs, threatened strikers who did not cooperate with the stoppage. Throwing of rocks and thermos bottles at a car taking strikers out of the factory, 5. Slapping of a customer who went to the factory to demand an order, 8. Attacks on two non-strikers on their way to the train. jf, A striker, revolver in overalls, grabbed a striker by the arm, tearing his suit, and 8. Deflation of the tires of a company car as it left the factory, Finding that the evidence showed that each of the eighteen strikers participated in one of the two acts, the Board unanimously rejected the allegations that the company had illegally dismissed them. As to the other six, the Board unanimously decided that the Company unlawfully discharged them because it had no evidence that they engaged in acts justifying discharge. The Board ordered the reinstatement of three of the six, retroactive to the time they offered to return to work. They are Angel Garda. Carlos Rivera and Virgilio Ortlz. The other three were reinstated as soon as the factory reopened. As to the companys action with the strikers loans, a majority of three members of the Board found that the company had interfered with the employees right to engage in union activities. In Puerto Rico, the case was with Continued on page 10, Col. 5 Sugar Production to be Limited to Individual Quotas, They Believe The U.S. Department of Agriculture yesterday issued a determination providing the mechanism by which proportionate shares individual quotas will be established for Puerto Ricos sugar farms for the 1950-51 crop. Under the provisions of the Sugar Act of 1948, it is specified that those sugar coffee producers who wish to qualify for payment must limit the milling of sugar coffee to an amount not to exceed the proportionate share individual quota established for their respective farms. The exact amount to which it will be necessary to limit production will not be announced until shortly before the beginning of the harvest. At the beginning of the current year, approximately 90,000 tons of sugar will be in stock. In view of the fact that for 1949-50 it is estimated that the crop will reach a record level of 1,290,000 tons, raw value, and in view of the restrictions imposed on the marketing of sugar during 1950, it is expected that at the beginning of 1951 there will be a larger surplus than in this year. The favorable conditions under which more crops are being harvested in other sugar-producing areas tend to indicate that in 1951 the marketing of sugar in Puerto Rico is limited to the basic quotas for export to the mainland market and local consumption stipulated in the Sugar Act, that is, to a total of approximately 1,015,000 tons of sugar. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the 1950-51 harvest in order to avoid the accumulation of an excessive surplus at the end of the year. The baso of a farm is computed using the production on the farm during the base period comprising the 194647 to 194950 harvests, inclusive. The total obtained by adding the three years of highest production is divided by three and the coefficient obtained is divided by two. To this amount is then added half of the highest production of the farm in any of the basic years. The proportional shares for all farms, except small and new farms, will be determined by the application of the Continued on page 16, Col. 5 Will Serve Jail Sentence in Hospital fl kamm JHb Mrs. Josefina Serrano Colon arrives at the Ponce Municipal Hospital carrying her two-month-old daughter, Julia Esther, in her arms, to remain there as a rechina Photo EL MUNDO. Judge Decides in Case of Beverage Law Defendant This Mother of Two Young Children is a Sick Woman - Other Cases in Ponce Court PONCE, May 28 By Miguel Rivera- A woman who was found guilty of violation of the Beverage Law, will serve the 30-day sentence imposed by the judge, at the Municipal Hospital. Judge Angel Umplerre, who is acting in the District Court in the bolita cases, will be sentenced to 30 days in the Municipal Hospital. Judge Angel Umplerre, who is acting in the District Court in the bolita and beverage cases, sentenced Josefina Serrano Colón to pay a fine of 100 or serve 30 days in jail, if found guilty of infraction to the Beverage Law. The defendant, who is a sickly woman in her 20s, appeared in court accompanied by her 80-day-old daughter. When the case was called, the defendant was breastfeeding the child, for which Judge Umplerre called her attention, declaring among other things that it was a sad spectacle, that there were other places for that, and that the Court was not one of them. Prosecutor Salvador Veray charged the accused that in the Cerro Gordo neighborhood of Villalba, two gallons of rum were seized. The accused was sentenced to a 100 fine or 30 days in jail, and she broke free in the middle of the courtroom. Upon being taken to the District Jail, so that she could begin to extinguish the sentence, the accused went with the minor, refusing to admit her, Mayor Amado Caplfall. The unhappy woman reported that she had no one to leave the child with, as well as another minor of one year of age, that she had left with a neighbor in Villalba. Doctor Fidel Alonso Caifias, from the Tricoche Hospital, examined the accused, finding that she was suffering from anemia due to malnutrition, besides suffering from a hysterical attack. Several District Court officials reported the case to Judge Umplerre, who ordered that, since the defendant was ill, she be confined in the Municipal Hospital while she recovered from her illness. To our questions, the defendant told us that she has two children, the youngest Julia Esther, who is not yet two months old, or Israel, of one sfio. She alleged that her husband, Aurelio Serrano Santiago, passed away about 8 months ago, before Juila Esther was born, and that she has no relatives, earning her living by ironing and washing clothes as well as sewing.

SANCHEZ CAPPA , Editor, EL MUNDO A gradually worsening crisis in the foreign cement market, in the countries which Ponce Cement was partly supplying, has obliged the factory to reduce its production, exports and personnel. This was revealed yesterday by Mr. Luis A. Ferré, vice-president of Ir, the company that owns Ponce Cement. It was informed that the mentioned cement factory notified the workers union that it was necessary to decree the dismissal of a number of workers due to the problem that has arisen in the foreign market where the price of the product has suffered a demoralization mainly due to the competition of European countries that are already exporting. According to the letter sent by the company to the Union, the situation of the demand for cement in the local and foreign market made necessary the reduction of its production and the suspension of a list of workers effective next Thursday. The number of suspended workers is 92. The leaders of the Union went to San Juan yesterday to discuss the matter with the leadership of the CGT CIO. of which the Union is a subsidiary. They discussed the problem with senior Armando Rlvero, secretary general of the Union. Ferrés opinion For his part, Mr. Ferré. Questioned on the matter, he reported that a demoralization of the foreign market, especially in Venezuela, motivated by low prices arising from the competition of European producing countries, has caused Ponce Cement to take measures to reduce its personnel, while making the necessary adjustments in maritime transportation costs in order to successfully face the European competition. Sefior Ferré further stated that in the public hearings before the Industrial Committee Number 7 to recommend minimum wage for the Industry, opposing an increase in the cement Industry wage he raised the situation described. He said that the price of cement abroad has dropped considerably. Ponce Cement has reduced its daily production from 25,000 to 20,000 cubes, while on the other hand it has limited its exports, he announced. He added that this demoralizing situation in the price of cement began to be felt at the beginning of the year. It has been gradually worsening, so the company has taken the necessary measures.

PU-The Western powers urged Russia to accept 1 the holding of free elections throughout Germany, to guarantee individual liberties throughout the country, to prohl. The Western countries urged Russia to accept the use of secret police and military forces, to cooperate in the establishment of a single economy for the German nation, and to return the factories which they have confiscated in their zone of occupation in Germany. This exhortation, aimed at achieving the unification of Germany, was made in separate notes which the American, British and French High Commissioners sent to their Soviet colleague. The notes were sent to their Soviet colleague General Vassily Ivanovich Chulkov at a time when there is great tension in Berlin over the gigantic meeting which half a million young German Communists propose to hold here under Russian auspices. No one is confident that the Russians will accept these conditions, but some observers think that the notes may lead to an empty conference to discuss the German problem and especially the peace treaty with Germany. Moreover, the notes categorically contradict the accusations of Communist speakers that the Western powers are to blame for the division of Germany. The note begins In reaffirming the determination of its governments to work together, in cooperation with the German government, and with all like-minded palse, for the division of Germany, the Communist Party has been able to make a clear and unequivocal case for the division of the country.

PUE1 Resident Commissioner Antonio Femó Isérn today asked the federal government to take Puerto Rico into account whenever it is asked to lower the tariff on foreign goods. Addressing the Epeclal Committee on Reciprocal Information, Fernó stated that this committee is acting not only for the people of the UnitedStates, but also for the people of Puerto Rico, a people facing a somewhat different economic complex. The Committee e t is taking up 1a idea of the American businessman and the people in ge. neral work the question of how much this pals should impose of contri, buclone over 2,000 to 3,000 import artlcu los. The United States will meet with sixteen other countries in Torquay, England, in eptlember, to negotiate a new possibly lower tariff on these items, Noting with interest the change from a high American tariff to a low one, Fernós said. Puerto Rico cannot but be apprehensive lest the impact of this change have undue effects on the local economy. Production Ixwal The mainland manufacturer, Fernós said, tat perhaps could accept concessions made to foreign goods against the against which Puerto Rico cannot successfully fight. Besides. Puerto Rico produces some articles of the kind in which the continental manufactures are no longer Interested, such as hand needlework, hand-made cigar, hand-made psja hat, tiles, snoods, and many hand-decorated articles. The concessions on the items are not limited to the handmade items.Continued on page 10, Col. 4 33 Passengers Died When Trolley Crashed Into Truck That Blew Up The trolley control system has had nine accidents in the past four years.

In approving the bill, the Committee made three amendments to the original version, including 1. In section doj. the bill now specifically requires that the law, after its approval by Congress, be submitted to the people of Puerto Rico, through an insular referendum for their approval or rejection. The clause stipulating that the Constitution would take effect if Congress did not act on it, ninety days after the President submitted it, was eliminated by the Committee, inserting the following sentence The Constitution shall take effect immediately after its approval by Congress. In section five, the Committee eliminated the provision that allowed the President, at the request of the Legislature and the Governor of Puerto Rico, to exempt the Island from any federal laws that were not otherwise applicable. So in this way the bill would take a step backward by removing the Presidents authority under the present Charter. S expects that the Committee will receive , a report on the bill later today. and that passage of it . will be virtually automatic.  The Voters Committee members who attended the special session and who voted unanimously to report the measure to the Senate were- . were Chairman Joseph C. OMshoney, Democrat. OMshoney, Democrat of Wyoming; Senators Clinton P. Anderson, Democrat of New Mexico; Guy Gordon, Republican of Oregon; Zale N. Ecton, Republican of Montana; Arthur V. Watkins, Republican of Utah; Herbert H. Lehman, Democrat of New York, and Glen Taylor, Democrat of Idaho. Resident Commissioner Dr. Antonio Fernos Isern, whose version of the bill is in the House Public Lands Committee awaiting testimony by Representative Vito Marcantonio, American Labor of New York, when the House resumed session on June 5, hailed the Senate committees action as an indication that the bill will pass. In addition, the bill has the endorsement of the overwhelming majority of the people of Puerto Rico, Fernós said. - including the governing party and some minority groups, labor and civic organizations, etc.; and aside from the unquestionable merits of the bill, I believe that the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee had before it two propositions  First as the bill neither concedes, precludes or promises Ja independence, does not concede, preclude or promise statehood, or advocate or oppose independence or statehood, it is ii materlsl to present considerations. And secondly, since according to the terms of the bill itself, it is optional for the people of Puerto Rico to accept or reject the opportunity to use or not use the authority contained in the bill for the adoption of the Constitution, they should be left to decide for themselves in a referendum whether or not they are in favor of the bill. Resolved in the Affirmative Apparently both propositions were resolved in the affirmative by the Committee. Questioned about the Committees amendments, he said that the first amendment, clarifying the wording of the provisions for holding an Island-wide referendum so that the people would accept or reject the bill, was adopted at his suggestion to ensure that the bill, after its approval by Congress, would go to the people for their approval or rejection. On the second amendment, eliminating the ninety-day provision authorizing the Constitution to take effect if Congress did not act within that period, Fernós said he believed that the experience of Congress with the Presidents reorganization plans had made that method extremely unpopular. The Reorganization Act authorized putting the plans into effect if they were not cancelled by Congress within ninety days. However. Fernós said he believed that the Committee was not in agreement.

Arrest Of Scientist Causes Alarm Even Motivated White House Meeting - Had Atomic Secret By LOUIS CASSELS WASHINGTON, February 3 - PU -- Official Washington was greatly alarmed today by the arrest in London, on charges of espionage, of atomic scientist Karl Fuchs, who was privy to the most vital American secrets and may have turned them over to Russia. Two investigations were immediately ordered. The Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy called Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves, head of the Manhattan atomic project during the war, to appear for testimony at 1030 a.m. Saturday morning. He will be questioned behind closed doors about Euclus work from 1943 to 1946 on the American atomic atomic project. Democrat Brien McMahon Conectlcut, who chairs the committee, omitted an aupena for Groves, but he said he would appear voluntarily. Groves said at his home in Norwalk, Conn. Connecticut, that Fuchs was sent here in 1943 as a leading member of an English atomic mission and that his loyalty was guaranteed by his own government. The House Committee on Un-American Activities announced that it will investigate Fuchs activities in connection with the investigation begun some time ago into Russian atomic espionage during the war. Meeting With Truman President Truman . discussed the profimdas Implications of the arrest with his Cabinet, The White House disclosed that the Executive obtained reports of the Imminent arrest on Tue shortly nnte he ordered the strictest precautions in the new American project le manufacture of the hydrogen superbomb. Official statements of the American atomic authorities indicated that Fuchs had access to the stored endowments of the atomic bomb model used against Japan. Russia exploded an atomic bomb last summer - a year earlier than many American atomic experts had expected. Continued on p. 14, Col. 2 During the early hours of the morning.  One of the urbanizations most affected by the floods was that of Puerto Nuevo, where in many streets the water rose to a level higher than the hawks of the houses, getting inside, with the consequent deterioration of the furniture. In the 12th Street of Puerto Nuevo there is a group of houses whose patio adjoins a high hill, from where stone has been extracted for constructions. The heavy downpours caused a landslide in this hill, falling several tons of stone and earth in the patio of the houses on 12th Street, with serious danger for the residents. Jos neighbors reported that no e speak registered personal misfortunes, but that the noise ocaalonado by the stone and earth to fall, greatly alarmed the neighborhood.

B SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1949 NUMBER 13815 FIVE CENTS Interior Requests 815,606,500 For 1950 Substantial amount to be devoted to roads Plans to isolate land ceded by Navy to avoid slums Fnr S. GAIvm Mataran Editor of EL MUNDO More than five million dollars has been requested by the Department of the Interior for the first phase of the Seventh Economic Program. The total amount requested by the Department amounts to 15,608,500 of which 4,000,000 would be dedicated to the construction and improvement of island highways and urban roads. These funds would be matched with federal funds. For the construction of municipal roads, the Department is requesting 3,000,000 for this first year, and for the reconstruction of existing roads, 2,000,000, and 300,000 for improvements to existing urban roads. Other Projects The Department of the Interior has also requested for this first year of the Economic Program, 300,000 for equipment and materials 45,000 for improvements to the building where the Departments central offices are located; 250,000 to continue the completion of the Island Capitol; 8,500 for needs at the Capitanías de Puerto; and 17,000 for the construction of a bridge over the Cerrillo River in the city of Ponee. Among the requests for funds from the Department of the Interior, submitted to the Planning Board, is one for 55,000 for the construction of an air fence on public lands in San Juan Bay. José R. Nogueras, head of the Finance Division of the Planning Board, explained yesterday that the request is based on the purpose of preventing the land ceded to the Island Government by the Tenth Naval District, in the port area, from becoming a slum. The officials of the Department of the Interior believe, explained Mr. Nogueras, that by building this fence around the land, it will prevent houses from appearing overnight, thus eliminating the possibility that after a few months another slum will be developed in the metropolitan area. Topographic Map The Department of the Interior also requests the sum of 80,000 for the preparation and publication of a topographic map of the Island at a scale of one by sixty thousand, and 50,000 for the execution of a flight over the Island, in connection with the same work. In connection with the flight, in its report to the Board, the Department of the Interior states that the last one that was made was in the year 1940, and since said date up to the present, an infinite number of highways have been built on the Island, and therefore, the same is now obsolete. The purpose is to take topographic views. The Department of the Interior also requests 5,931,000 for operating expenses. Isabela Irrigation In connection with the Isabela Irrigation, 8,140,000 is requested for the completion of hydroelectric plant number 4 and for the construction of rural electrification plants, 40,000.

In accordance with the recent statement of the Rector of the UPR, in the sense that the School of Medicine will begin to operate soon, the President of the Medical Association, Dr. Manuel Astor, published a statement addressed to the medical class, in his Monthly Letter. The statements dl Dr. Astor read as follows Recently there has been published in the daily Press, extensive information in rala, clon with the School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico, which in all probability will begin to function when the next school year begins. This presidency has had the opportunity to hold several exchanges of impressions with Rector Benitez and with Dr. Brown, and has been able to personally corroborate all the information published. Reiterates Cooperation We are very pleased that the efforts to provide our island with a medical school, have reached their full development, and we are even more pleased to see that all efforts towards this end have been channeled along the path traced by 1 Medical Association, ie, towards 1 organizes, clon of a medical school that is at the height of the most prestigious in this hemisphere. On repeated occasions we have offered to Rector Renltez and Dr. Brown the most determined support of the Puerto Rican medical class for the successful realization of their projects. The President of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Ftllpo de Mostos, in a letter addressed to our editor, Mr. Enrique Ramirez Brau, indicates that the information that appeared in yesterdays edition of EL MUNDO, about the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, gives the impression that he, Mr. De Mostos, was the source of information from which Ramirez Brau obtained the data that was published. In this regard, our editor states It is my purpose to inform the readers of EL MUNDO that Mr. De Mostos was not the person from whom I obtained the information about the meeting held by the Chamber of Commerce. The source of information was another and this one cannot be revealed by 1 journalist, It is true that, as on every occasion, I approached Mr. De Mostos to request, if possible, that he give me details of the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce, which he refused to do.

J.M. Comba, D-Texas, told Congress that the inclusion of Puerto Rico in the old-age and survivors insurance provisions of the Social Security Act was very justified and proper. In a statement in the Congressional Record, Combs expressed his appreciation on behalf of two million American citizens for the Houses adoption of the measure, which constituted a unanimous recognition of Puerto Ricos need for the direct assistance provisions of social security. Thus, Combs added, ten years after the social security system went into effect, Puerto Rico appears to be on its way to substantial participation in it. The House measure, as passed, he said, represents progress for Puerto Rico. Its effect, he said, over the next few years, will help make the island a more complete social community. Comba said it was just 1a Inclusion of Pitarlo Rico. IF a national social insurance system is Justified, he added, then there is little justification for discriminating on regional or local grounds.  NecMlted of Insurance The higher the Income, no matter where a beneficiary lives, the less the need to extend the canco of insurance; the lower the Income, no matter where the beneficiary lives, the greater the need for extension. Low incomes in Puerto Rico, he said, are attributed, not  a low cost of living or an indifference to opportunity d work but to a lack of capital, which provides for higher productivity, and as a consequence, higher incomes. 1,0a Tala workers only earn enough, in their a fio of vitality, to continue to uh lation, Combs declared. Serla contrary to the flloaifla of social insurance the Insist that in Ja old age the deprivations of lá life are not reduced, but that the peaares of Youth and middle age continue and ae aggravated. It is preferable, he said, that the low-income workers should not merely be guaranteed direct assistance during their old age, but a penalty which, to a large extent, they themselves have paid for. Durant artos los consumidores puertorrlquefios han atado pagando por 1a majority d sus alimentos y otros productos de consumo a lo precio del Continente, said Combs, Jos qu seguramente reflejan Impuestos de seguro social para los obreros continentales. He added that social security is as much a part of the American way of life as free education, and is as important to all American citizens as military security. It is not fair to live and work, he said, and consume, within the American economic system, and yet be deprived of the economic security that the system is supposed to offer its component parts. And Puerto Rico has been a component part of the American economic system since 1900. Combs said the contention in the House that the inclusion of Puerto Rico would create an undue burden on the Federal Insurance Fund was unfounded. Puerto Ricans, as consumers. on dependent on the Mainland for most of their products; at present they indirectly pay  that fund. He did not Cont. on page 14, Col. 7.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 PU - The House Ways and Means Committee has approved a bill to increase the postage rate by 130,000,000. The bill doubled the rates for postcards from one cent to 2 cents, and increased most of the rates for second-class material, which includes newspapers and other publications. The Committees experts estimated that postcards alone would add 16,000,000 annually to the mail receipts The increase in second-class matter amounted to 1,1,500,000. The Senate passed a similar bill increasing postal rates by 100,000,000. 1 The proposed increase has fallen far short of that desired by Postmaster General Jesse M. Donaldson to meet the deficit in his department which amounts to about 500,000,000 annually. For newspapers, the increase would be about ten percent of what Donaldson had asked for.

MeC ABE  Uorrespon el rie United Press WASHINGTON, July 11 PU - The House rte Representan! The House of Representatives today approved the 1947 sugar bill, which extends the domestic quota system for five years at a fixed tonnage and gives Cuba a larger share of the U.S. sugar market. The measure was approved by a voice vote and the number of votes was not counted. The measure now passes to the Senate, where its passage is almost assured, since it was filed under the formidable auspices of 33 enario, res, most of it from the western beet-producing area, The bill replaces the sugar law of 1937, and the main difference between the new and the old measure is that the 1947 sugar bill fixes sugar quotas for the domestic area on the basis of stable tonnage and not on the basis of the percentage of the domestic sugar market, The measure approved by the Lower House today distributes among the domestic area 4,268,000 tons of raw value. The measure passed by the Lower House today allocates between Is domestic 4,268,000 tons gross value. 1,1500,000; Hawaii, 1,052,000; Puerto. Rico, 910,000; and Virgin Island, 6,000. Before it was submitted to Congress, the bill was approved by the beet and charter area and by a large part of the offshore carte- nary zone. Since it was introduced, and during the hearing before the House Committee on Agriculture, there has been criticism of the distribution of the quota, mainly from the representatives of the Island Government and the growers of Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican centralists have consistently supported the project as the best we can get. j It also provides that Cuba will net 98.64 percent of the Philippine sugar deficit. Under the 1946 Commerclel treaty, the Flf llpinas are guaranteed a quota in the United States of 952,000 short ton for the next 28 years. Under the present sugar law any Philippine shortfall is allocated to foreign pal pales, except Cuba. I Representative Clifford Hope, Republican of Kansas, and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee which approved the measure, has estimated that the Philippine deficit will be 700,000 tons during the next harvest. The bill tested by the House of Representatives provides that Cuba shall receive not less than 28.6 percent of U.S. domestic consumption during the next five years. Most  zAicarero experts believe that the consumption of sugar in the United States during the next five years will be at a level high enough for Cubas   quota to exceed 28.6 percent, and that there will be Continued on page 20 Road program during I; O I 1946-47 was 5,788,877.00 i Interior formalized 30 contracts dr works qpe  covered bridge construction and 67 kms. of  roads. -Municipal secondary roads  The road construction program in Puerto Rico, carried out by the Department of the Interior during the fiscal year that ended on June 30 last year, was carried out with an investment of 877, according to figures released yesterday by the Subcommittee. efinr Jesús Benitez Castafio.

The committee adopted this agreement because it came to the conclusion, as reported yesterday, that the traffic lights on the San Juan road are slowing down the traffic. i - The Parts Conference has been held at the same time. He soberly warned the mlem broa of the Committee, in an ae lón ecret that went on for ninety minutes, that the United States must  be prepared for any test that may be in store for it to come.

For example, the British government,  invoking the Official Secrets Act enacted in 1911, declared no-go areas, the Harwell experimental station in Berkshire, the nuclear physics laboratory at Risley, in Lancashire, and the Ministry of Supply factories at Springfield, also in Lancashire. Meanwhile. Str Wallace Akers, director of the Atomic Inveatlgactons during the war, revealed that the United States and Great Britain a have objected to the discussion of problems related to atomic energy - at the scientific conference which will open soon in London, and to which representatives of twenty-eight nations will be attending. He said Aker; Both Governments, which participated in the development of atomic energy, are opposed to the discussion of problems related to the functioning of the atom, pending the conclusion of a preliminary agreement. New Message Drafted with Study of General Situation Held Meeting with Advisers Considered Miners Contract and Possible Influence on Prices By MERRIMAN SMITH Cor responso I of United Press WASHINGTON, July II. PU-President Trumon has decided to bring Congress up to date on the economic condition of the nation, so that he will have all the facts and figures, prices and production to think about during his summer vacation. Although not required by law,  1 fior Trum n will probably send a mid-term report covering economic developments on January 1 to the Senate and House within the next day. Because of the closeness of the date on which the Congress will adjourn, which has been set for July 26, it is expected that the report will not recommend any immediate legislation. The Secretary of the White House, Charle G. Rom, said that the President speaks arrival at the meeting of a long meeting ata mafiana with the Cabinet and the Council of Aae-l-aorea Económlcoa. The lecturer spent much time considering the  perepectlva of agriculture and 1 effect ponlble that ojona on -o price the Jornale egg contract signed by John U lwl with lo operadoto of the nations coal. IF lo price tibiarán  ro-ulta of the coal pmbloma anludón, ean eerie a aaunta of concern, - said Rom. Faro added that the consensus at the meeting was that there was a tendency to exaggerate the importance of the coal deal in the overall picture of the day. Dr. Edwin G. Nourae, chairman of the Economic Council, presented a detailed report on the days wages, prices and changes in coal production at the first of the year. Ro said that 1 efior Truman had decided that it would be advantageous to Congress - and to the people, too - to publish the Report hour, even though the law requires that he submit, once a time. an economic analysis ron his recommendations, to the Senate and the House. The President submitted his report a few days after Congress met, on January 3. The agricultural outlook was presented by 1 Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Norrie E. Dodd. Dodd said the corn crop estimate, given yesterday, showing more than 600,000,000 bushels less than last year, was based on figures compiled in the previous two weeks. Since then, he said, the weather has been more favorable and conditions have improved. He added that the wheat outlook is now much better than when the last crop estimate, which was announced about two weeks ago, was made. In addition to the Cabinet and the Economic Council, the President invited several of the most prominent oxRerto attend the conference, among whom were Larry S. Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, 1 Budget Chairman James B. Webb, and James B. F. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. C., President of the Federal Reserve Board, and the President of the Federal Reserve Board. James B. Webb, and John R. Steelman, assistant to the Chief Executive. The presence of these advisors indicated that the discussion also involved the prospect for future government financ- ing. Particularly the disbursements that may be made under the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Europe. But there was no confirmation of this, either from the Roas or from the speakers. I With the signing of the contract between John L. Lewis and the coal mine refineries, a period of peace in industry which will last at least until July 1, 1948, seems to be assured. The nations major industries - steel, automobiles, shipping and railroads - signed agreements with their respective labor unions long before Lewis and his miners reached an agreement with the operators of the bituminous coal mines. The conflict between the workers and the telephone companies was also recently settled. In the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, there is also a contract signed between the unions and the main companies engaged in these activities. . Although in the opinion of the coal mine operators, 1 the price of fuel will rise by a dollar a ton - representing an additional expense to the conaumtdnrea of 600,000,000 a year - 1 the supply of coal for industry and for private uses, such as heating, has been assured. The Union of Minoroo contract also covers the coal producing company, Continued on page 20\n",

B San Juan, P. R., February 25, 1925. J. Pena Reyes. B  . - - . Secretary-Auditor The Treasurer will convene public hearings to hear the co-taxpayers of the areas through which the Oriente railroad will pass, in order to fix the proportional rate of contribution. The Committee of Commerce, which held meetings with the Island Treasurer and the Commissioner of the Interior to broadly discuss the proportion of taxation that would correspond to Fian Juan in relation to the bill for the construction of certain pieces of railroad in the Oriente district of the Island, will render the final result of its efforts, establishing, at the same time, the points of view to be followed by the House on the matter. With both officials, this committee extensively discussed the bill and all its details, including the portion that San Juan would be required to pay as a contribution in accordance with the aforementioned bill. Both officials treated the commissioners with the utmost courtesy, and the data supplied to them allowed them to render a clear and concise report on this important matter. It is known that there will be public hearings to set the tax rate to be paid by each region benefited by the aforementioned railroad system, and it seems that the Chamber of Commerce will be one of the first entities to attend them. The Law strictly fixes the rate of the special contribution at one and three fourths of one tenth of one percent. This means a special contribution for San Juan of 0.17-1J2 cts. per 100 of valuation. Today it pays 2.24 per 100,000. The Public Service Commission will fix the region benefited for the objects of this contribution. The Act says these will be those which will be traversed by the new lines or the lines junctioned with these new pieces. Since the tracks of the American Railroad Company connect in Carolina with the Mameyes section, some Government officials believe that San Juan constitutes a BENEFICIED region and should bear its share of the tax. The city of San Juan is assessed at 70,000.00. The special contribution would amount to 122,500 per year and distributed over the 20 years it would take to redeem the bonds, implies a high investment of San Juan taxpayers money in these works. Surely the Chamber of Commerce now wishes to deal with such an important matter, to resolve any contingencies that have not been foreseen so far, and not to oppose it.

Once in the field of the incident, we were able to observe that all the details reported by the press pale before the reality of the incident. The aspect is in exk trem desolate and produces an effect of pity without limits. When we arrived at the site of the devastation, the National Guard was already on the scene, giving aid to the unfortunate people who were left homeless and without resources. Tents have been erected and countless military beds have been placed at the service of the homeless.

SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1949 NUMBER 13829 FIVE CENTS Unemployment Insurance Law Under Consideration Commission Outlines 12-Point Plan  Idea Is to Strengthen Existing Law - Increase in Sugar Quota To Be Requested By LUISSANCHEZ CAPPA Editor of EL MUNDO The legislative commission studying unemployment and the effects of mechanization in the sugar industry agreed at its last meeting to evaluate the system of employment insurance in the sugar industry on the basis of present practical results and problems. . The agreement is part of a twelve-point work program submitted to the committee by its technical advisors. In order to conduct the inquiry on employment insurance, the commission will request reports from the agencies involved in the implementation of the law that created the insurance. It shall also hold public hearings to hear suggestions on the weak points of the insurance and how to strengthen them. The commission shall also prepare draft bills, if necessary, to improve said insurance. Last Meeting The Commission met last Thursday under the chairmanship of Speaker, Ledo. Ernesto Ramos Antonlnl, also present were representatives Pedro Vega Barrio, Francisco Diaz MSrchand, Carlos Rahassa, Francisco Sanchez, Joaquin Torre Noriega, Candelario Arce, and Mr. Miguel Torres, assistant to the Speaker on labor matters. The committee of technical advisors of the Commission was attended by Mr. Ramón Colón Torres, Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, Mr. Fernando Sierra Berdecla, Commissioner of Labor, Mr. Cándido Oliveras, President of the Minimum Wage Board, and Mr. Juan Labadle, of the Budget Bureau. It was agreed to ask Mr. Gul. llormo Sorra, head of the Agricultural Economics Division of the Experimental Station, to join the body of advisors of the Commission, Agreements Adopted The Committee of Aeeeeree submitted to the Commission a work plan of twelve points, and the following agreements were adopted To appoint a Committee of Advisors for the purpose of reviewing the original report; directing any new studies that may be necessary; advising the Committee on the technical issues before it; and suggesting new recommendations and ratifying or revising those of the first report. It was further agreed to provide such additional information as may be available on mechanization and technological advances in the Puerto Rico sugar industry and other areas for which public hearings will be held to hear affected parties and interested persons, especially in connection with certain plans to initiate the manufacture of liquid sugar in Puerto Rico. Mr. Candido Oliveras, as Chairman of the Minimum Salary Board, shall submit to the House Committee a candidate who, acting as a technician, shall conduct any necessary surveys, such as a comparative study on the effects of the use of yerbiddas in relation to employment in the sugar industry. This technician will work permanently with the Commission. The technician will work with the Commission on an ongoing basis. The Commission shall also establish the basis for a campaign to obtain an increase in the sugar quota of Puerto Rico. It will also hear the president of the Development Company on the projects in force, or which may be put into effect, to industrialize sugar products, such as bagasse and honeys. The Commissions work program also includes the agreement to hold a meeting with officials related to the governments construction program. It will also hear from the Administrator of the Emergency Program, the Head of Title V of the Land Authority, and the members of the Planning Board, and any other agencies on the possibility of establishing a program for the development of small industries that could counteract the effects of seasonal unemployment in the sugar industry. They were called to discuss the possibility of coordinating the payment of proportional benefits with other programs aimed at correcting the effects of unemployment. The idea was to see that the proportional benefits be paid by the TA after the end of the unemployment compensation payment.

Géigel Explains Implications Sugar Case Says Status Solution Will Not Depend on Supreme Court Decision By Benjamín Santana EL MUNDO Staff Writer Attorney General Vicente Géigel Polanco reported yesterday that the matter brought before the National Supreme Court, regarding the refining of sugar .on the Island, was a purely constitutional matter.  The Head of the Department of Jua tlcla returned yesterday to his offices, to attend to numerous cases pending his study, in spite of being suffering from a strong flu. Expanding on some statements made earlier by Attorney General Jose Trias Monge, in relation to the sugar case, Géigel Polanco warned that the solution to the political status of the Island will not depend, in any way, on the decision reached by the U.S. Supreme Court Justices. In the case in question, brought by Central Roig, of Yabucoa, attorneys Géigel and Trias alleged that the limitation imposed on the refining of sugar on the island is unconstitutional. Both Attorney Géigel Polanco and Deputy Attorney General Trias Monge have refrained from predicting the possible ruling of the National Supreme Court in this case, since the case is sub-Judice, that is to say, pending resolution. Géigel stated, however, that the least the judges could decide is that, although it is true that Congress has the power to regulate the Islands economic relations with the Continent, these have to be on a basis of equity and Justice. Whatever the final decision may be, however, it will help to raise the political issue Continued on page 16, Col. 1.

Law Benefits Housing Plan For Veterans Uberaliza las Normas Para los Préstamos. - Puerto Rican veterans who have applied or want to apply for mortgage loans for the construction of homes will benefit from the new legislation approved by President Truman on home loans, to be processed through the Federal Homes Administration. This was reported yesterday by Mr. D. A. Carpenter, director of the agency inala. Mr. Carpenter explained that the new home loan legislation under the FHA liberalizes lending by allowing the Financial Reconstruction Administration to purchase 100 percent of mortgages from banks. Local banks have been reluctant to lend under the AFH to veterans because of the limited mortgage market in the Financial Reconstruction Administration. That agenda could only buy 50 percent of the mortgages. Mr. Carpenter said that banking firms will now have a secure and complete market for mortgages and will be in a better position to finance veterans housing projects. Previous difficulties, he added that the difficulties encountered by veterans in obtaining home loans have been overcome by the new legislation. Many veteran loan applicants had been unable to finance their homeownership loans under the AFH. . He believes that there will now be an upsurge in veterans loan olidtudoi through the liberalization of federal law. As for the projects of the contractor firm that plan to initiate low-cost housing constructions through the agency, this official said that they are under study and consideration. As is known, the Fullana Corporation, a native contractor entity, has proposed a housing project at a maximum cost of 3,700 per unit. He indicated that up to the present, there is nothing definitive about this project, which has been submitted by the contracting firm for the consideration of Governor Muñoz Marín.

Joyc, son. Mr. Joyc also announced that the plant will be used for the manufacture of shoulder shoes under the name of Joyc of Puerto Rico. The plant was built and operated by the Compartía d Fomento Industrial de Puerto Rico. When questioned yesterday by the Compartía de Fomento Industrial on the matter, Salvador Tió, Public Relations Officer of said agenda, informed EL MUNDO that the sale of the shoe factory to the Joyce firm is certain. He said, What has been done is to lease the factory the building and the machinery has been sold to them, with an option to buy the building. When asked about the price of the transaction, Mr. TIÓ said that the contract had just arrived from the United States and did not stipulate the price. He further stated that the sales action was signed by Mr. Teodoro Moscoao, Jr. and Mr. William H. Joyce, Jr. in Pasadena. Mr. Tió added that the Compartía de Fomento sold the shoe factory because it has in mind to sell all of its factories to continue financing new enterprises.

New Cases By Lula Hornándes Aquino EL MUNDO Staff Writer An increase in the number of cases of infant polio was registered during the last two days in the metropolitan area, where five of them were admitted to the Bayamón District Hospital and the Presbyterian Hospital. Four of the cases were registered in Santurce. The Chief of the Bureau of Epidemiology, Dr. Abel de Juan, said yesterday that these cases will be studied carefully to determine if some of them have been imported from the United States. There are at least two of the patients who are American. It is expected that next year there will be a strong epidemic outbreak of infant paralysis, precisely on the fourth anniversary of the epidemic that occurred in the island, of which 307 cases were reported, in some of which the patients died. The new Cauca Lo new csso reported on the 27th and 28th are the following Do. mingo Díaz Meléndez. street number 6, Barrio Obrero; Wllfredo Ocasio, enserio Villa Palmeras, street number 3, Santurce; Whitney Bourdman, Emajagua street number 3, Pun Las Marías, Santurce Charle Jame Nolan, Pflnta Las Marias, Bucaré street number 30, and Félix Gómez Rivera, 16 months old, Bella Vista, Rio Piedras. All of these cases, with the exception of Whitney Bourdman, were admitted and are under observation at the District Hospital in Baya, Mon. Whitney is confined at Presbyterian Hospital. The practice when a case of infantile paralysis arises is that the public health physician and the private physician immediately send him to the nearest district hospital, so that the case is isolated until it is finally determined whether it is positive or not and to what degree the disease has reached. Once 1 case is established in a district hospital, information is forwarded to the Epidemiology Bureau, which studies the clinical record of the case and determines the policy to be followed. As for the new cases, at least two of them, an attempt will be made to determine whether they are imported or not. The Chief of the Epidemic Bureau, Dr. De Juan, said that it may be that people coming from abroad are more susceptible than the residents here, where there was an outbreak a few years ago, which has given some immunity. Thirty-five Caaoa So far this year, 35 cases of infantile paralysis have been re. glatred in Puerto Rico, distributed as follows San Juan, 7; Isabela, 1; Rio Piedras, 2; Vega Baja, 1; Dorado, 1; Toa Alta. 1; Guayanilla, 2; Carolina, 1; Rio Grande, 1; Naguabo, 2; Vieques, 1; Caguas, 5; Cayey, 1; Santa Isabel, 1; Barranquitas, 1; Orocovis, 1; Ponce, 3; Guayanilla, 3. A study of the statistics of the Department of Health since the year of the epidemic indicates that in that year, 1946, 307 cases were recorded; in 1947 they dropped to 57 and in the year 1948 they were reduced to 30. So far this year the number of cases has risen to 35. During the 1946 epidemic, the towns most affected were the following, with the number of cases for the date of the epidemic San Juan, .33; Rio Piedras. 30; Ponce, .41; Yauco, 14; Juana Díaz, 17; Guayanilla 16.

Dr. Jalma Serra Chavarry, director of the VA, informed yesterday that the Administration will not pay neither to veterans nor to the institution for enrollments whose certificates do not indicate the above. Dr. Serra Chavarry added that this limitation will not affect veterans who possess original eligibility certificates, which are considered to be few. They must return it Because  that with those certifica, two the veterans will not be able to enroll the next marte, the Ad. mlniitraclón of Veterans recommends that they be returned with a letter in whered the veterans inform the name of the course they wish to take, e1 name and address of the Institution in which they wish to take said courses, and reasons that de. The letter should show that the courses they wish to take are related to the studies previously taken or sponsored by the Veterans Administration. It was made clear that all original certificates, issued before November 1, 1949, would be valid even if they did not indicate the name of the course and the name of the authorized institution. Dr. Serra Chavarry added that for the purpose of granting additional educational benefits to veterans who have satisfactorily taken one or more courses, or who have dropped a course for any justifiable reason, the Veterans Administration will consider the fact that the new course requested is immediately related to the last course completed or interrupted by the veteran.

Columbia L Group Finalizes Report Affirms That Puerto Rico Needs Higher Level Of Culture Pnr Benjamín San tan  EL MUNDO Staff Writer The final report r. lated to the total reform of the school system in Puerto Rico is ready, Commissioner Mariano Villaronga said yesterday. The Report will be brought personally, by Dr. Gordon Mackenzie, on November 7, and delivered to the Governor and the Commissioner of Instruction. - The recommendations made in the Report are the results of a study carried out by a group of educators from Columbia University under the direction of Dr. Mackenzie. In the aforementioned report, the Columbia educators urge that all school-age children in Puno Rico have at least elementary school preparation. Although enrollment in public schools has increased steadily this year, there are still 243,000 children between the ages of six and twelve outside the classroom, and more than 300,000 between the ages of six and 18. Free Program According to preliminary data submitted to the Department of Instruction, the Columbia educators allege in their report that the high school program on the island is unduly academic and bookish. It is urgent that greater vocational opportunities and community service experiences be provided so that young people will leave the classroom better prepared for the struggle of life. V This recommendation has already been taken up by Commissioner Mariano Villaronga in the Six Year Plan he recently submitted to the Planning Board, in which, among other things, he said Without abandoning progress and improvement at the other levels, s emphasis is placed on the structuring of a basic educational service for all, or practically all children of Peurto Rieo. - It is infinitely better that almost all of our children receive a minimal but essential education for civic life, than that resources be dispersed in a few elementary and secondary schools. In this plan, Commissioner Villaronga points out two cardinal purposes that of providing six years of elementary schooling to every child between the ages of six and twelve, and the expansion of the Vocaclonal Instru- . ction program. On the need for this type of Instruction, he said that e imperative in our environment, and all educators point out the results Unsatisfactory of an overly formal and academic education. Other Recommendations Puerto Rico needs a higher level of general culture, according to the Report, as a means to increase its productivity, Assuring him I that there is a high positive correlation between the degree of education rte a people and their productivity. The educationalists also point out the need to decrease 1 number of failures, particularly at 1 ; elementary level, claiming that such a  decrease is not only  Impresdn- I rtible as a measure of economy. 11- ! but it also ensures the admission to school of a greater number  of children. . Apart from these two powerful reasons, they suggest another no less important one for reducing the number of failures in the public schools a means of avoiding the emotional imbalance of the pupils who are not able to attend school. The emotional distress of students who see their hopes dashed. Other recommendations of the teachers, according to a preliminary report submitted to the Department of Education 1- To give greater participation to the lay people in the school program, using the community as a laboratory. 2- Intensify the social and psychological lnve tlgadon  in Puerto Rico, I Continued on page 16, Col. 8  Aeronautics Board Revokes Strato Freights License that the plane, which plunged into the sea six minutes after taking off from San Juan de Puerto Rico, was carrying 2,473 pounds in excess of the allowable weight.

NUMBER 13424 Island Commerce registers new trademark Balance has been most unfavorable Expenditures on the mainland far exceed export income By Paul Hartón WASHINGTON, Sept. 10.-PU.-The Puerto Rico Council of Commerce said today that the dollar value of Puerto Ricos sales with the mainland and of Puerto Ricos purchases on the mainland set a new all-time high for the fiscal year ended June 30. However, the Council added, Puerto Ricos spending on the mainland exceeded the Islands receipts from its sales on the mainland by a greater margin than in the previous two years. The Council derived these conclusions from an analysis of U.S. Department of Labor statistics. This analysis will be published in the next issue of the Puerto Rican Trade Bulletin. The analysis was released today to the U.S. Press. Imports exceed According to the study. Puerto Rico shipped products to the mainland valued at 186,592,000 in the year ended June 30. During the same period, the island purchased products on the mainland valued at 337,155,000. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1947, the Council stated, the Islands exports were valued at 171,227,000 and imports at 279,322,000. The difference was 108,000,000. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1946, the Council said, the difference was 102,000,000. In the past few months, the Puerto Rico Board of Trade analysis revealed, the Islands balance sheet had become very unfavorable. The Council is still studying the situation to determine if there is cause for alarm. To date, it said, all that can be said is that the large wartime savings, tremendous revenues from federal sources, construction loans and capital investment have contributed greatly to the unfavorable balance sheet without necessarily threatening the island economy. What can be said with certainty, however, the Council said, is that never has the dollar value of Island trade been so high and never has the balance been so unfavorable. The main points in the picture of the Islands export trade are as follows 1 A substantial increase in the value and volume of sugar exports in the year ended June 30, as compared with the year ended June 30, 1947. Exports of all sugar products amounted to 124,297,000, in 1947-48, compared with 97,091,000 in 1946-47, Shipments of unrefined sugar rose from 683,285 tons to 836,129 tons. Shipments of refined sugar also rose and shipments of honeys almost doubled, from 23,785,000 gallons to 41,133,000 gallons. At the same time, shipments of rum fell from 2,082,000 gallons, valued at 7,020,000, to 416,000 gaIons, valued at 1,334,000. 2 Shipments of raw tobacco fell from 12,498,000 pounds, to 8,921,000, and e dollar value from 12,614,000 to 7,323,000. 3 Textile exports fell in value, from 36,962,000 to 31,450,000. Lu Imports On the Import side, clearly reflecting the increase in mainland prices, and in some cases an increase in Island consumption, are the following items 1 A substantial Jos Income in food expenditures. The total dollar value of all food imports rose from 81,187,000 to 112,017,000. Thus, for the year ending June 30, 1948, Puerto Ricos food imports came to approximately 50 per head. At the top of the list of the lions share were A An increase in imports of pork products from 25,740,000 pounds, valued at 8,788,000, to 34,980,000 pounds valued at 11,770,000. B Imports of lard rose from 31,910,000 pounds, valued at 11,209,000, to 44,757,000 pounds valued at 11,026,000 reflecting a reduction in the price of lard. C A decline in imports of dairy products from 41,540,000, valued at 11,356,000, s 36,119,000 valued at 12,186,000, reflecting sharp increases in prices. 2 A decline in Imports of clothing, other products, . les, of shoes, from VI,750,000 to  Continued on page 14  As they approach the Princess jail, three of loa students sentenced yesterday for .

This was reported yesterday by Colonel Rafael Gimenez de 1a Rosa, director of the Puerto Rico Selective Service. A reporter of this newspaper received the erroneous impression that Mr. D.

The appointment extended to Mr. Vazquez by President Truman, and on the recommendation of Governor Pifteroi e of Appeals Agent of the 63rd Local Board of Selective Service in San Juan, his duties being to advise said Board in all matters relating to the classification and determination of registrants, and to take appeals to the Board of Appeals for Puerto Rico.

A continuation of the negotiations, as if nothing had happened in Berlin. 3. A postponement of the negotiations until Russia offers an explanation of what happened in the German capital. In a conference with the Perlodists, the above-mentioned English spokesman declared that - Her Majestys Government regrets very much the incident in which police officers in the Ru o sector fired on the British zone, adding that this shooting, in which one German was killed and fourteen wounded, was the consequence of a chain of events which began with the Communist demonstrations inside and outside the Berlin City Hall. Ruaos prosecute fifteen The exchange between the Russian and the Allied with regard to Air Information occurred at the time when the Red announced the arrest and imminent military prosecution of fifteen Germans, accused of espionage for the benefit of the United States and Great Britain, in the Soviet occupation zone. Charges of espionage and other criminal activity in the East German state of Turlngla have been brought against the detainees. A small mail train, consisting of eight cars, passed through the Russian blockade, penetrating into the British sector, but G B. Thompson, Railway Director of that sector, was arrested. Thompson, railway director of that zone, stated that this does not constitute any indication that the blockade will be lifted in bravo. The newspapers which are published under the Ruhr license in Berlin are calling for a monstrous demonstration to be held tomorrow, Sunday, as an answer to the fascist mob which tore a Russian flag from the Brandenburg Gate last night. The Russian-controlled newspaper accuses the British authorities and officials of the Berlin city government of having deliberately stirred up provocations by attacking the police in the Soviet sector. New record In spite of the Russian air maneuver, the Anglo-American air force set a new record today. In the space of twenty-four hours, 714 planes were flown!

August downward trend continues Reduction trend ;e due to giant crops in Nation w CHICAGO. September 10.PU-Various price item allmen-, retail tyrians have been falling during the past month, e a survey has shown, but wholesale 1a meat prices remained high rie again. A 10-city survey revealed that butter, veal and sheeps milk, led the current downward trend in consumer prices. The decline followed a decline in wholesale prices, which induced grocery store owners to buy more liberally in the hope of inducing price-conscious housewives to buy more. But the Agriculture Department said today that the increased buying by retailers caused retail prices to rise again. Sheepmeat prices in Jos markets rose more than four cents a pound, while pork gained three cents and veal and beef, two cents. 1-those gains in part eontu- - saw the current followed by the price 1 pnr higher, as shown by Dun 4 Bradstreets essential item rie index, which deicended for four consecutive weeks. In addition, the Labor Department said average wholesale prices fell last week, with pronounced declines in fresh meat, beef and poultry. The survey showed that retail prices remained in line with last month. Butter was uniformly down about five cents per pound in 10 cities, while beef steak was down an average of 5.5 cents. Sheep cutlet prices averaged a reduction of 15 cents per pound. The survey showed no change in the prices of sugar, coffee and flour, although the wholesale price of staples fell in the past month. On the other hand, a United Press dispatch from Chicago says that are, in carhino lower prices for food,  according to the opinion rie tre  of the Nations largest  agricultural organizations. This good news for  consumers was announced  jointly by the National Grange, Federation rie Farm Businesses and National Council of Agricultural Cooperatives, They said the drop perada perada in food rie costs e produce it as a result of this aftos record-setting agricultural production. But they warned that in meat and other animal products, lower prices would not occur immediately, because it takes time to replace depleted beef herds. Their forecast came at the same time the Labor Department reported a decline in wholesale prices for the second consecutive year. The average wholesale prices for 900 staples fell 0.6 percent in the week ending last Saturday, mostly due to a decline in food prices of a few cents on the week. Prices of essential items, other than agricultural products, rose 0.1 percent. Wholesale prices still remained 8.1 percent higher than in August of last year, however, and the Departments wholesale food index remained at 167.4, using 1926 as the base year with the index figure of 100. Brent Spence, D-Kentucky, announced that he will propose an immediate wage and price freeze if the Democrats regain control of Congress in November. The three groups defended the Governments price support program, which Harold E. Staisen, as spokesman for the Republican Party, called an instrument of the Administration to keep prices high in an election. The program aimed at securing vast supplies, they said, has prevented food prices from reaching the high levels they would have reached, as they have in many other countries. The support provided ensures that agricultural commodity prices will not fall to collapse levels, plunging the Nations entire economy into a depression, as occurred in 1920-20, and in 1930-31.

Martinet Chapel EL MUNDO Staff Writer Governor Piftero has not yet decided whether he will approve the bills submitted to him by the Legislature at its last special session, amending the Election Law. It is expected that one of them will be vetoed by the government. There are three bills approved for that purpose by the legislative majority, with the vote against of the representatives of the minority parties. One of them determines that the polling stations shall be located in urban areas, and the Local Boards of Elections or the Island Board of Elections may authorize the establishment of polling stations in those rural neighborhoods where they were established in the 1944 general elections. Another of the projects mandates that the Junta Locale de Elecclone or the Junta Insular de Elecclone. put to dl cu16n and resolve, any motion presented by any of its members, even if such motion has not been seconded. These do projects shall be signed by the governor Plfte. ro, in the opinion of the portavoce riel llrieratn Popular and La Fortaleza. Board of Electoral Appeals The third bill, before the Governors con irieration, creates a Board of Electoral Appeals, composed of the Governor himself on the recommendation of the chairman of all the political parties, to resolve the ties which arise in the electoral boards, at present the exclusive mission of the Governor. This project was strongly opposed by the legislators of the minority, on the grounds that the Board of Appeals would be a parapet behind which the Governor would hide it to resolve in a partisan manner the appeals submitted to him, since the Governor, being the one who appoints the Board, would always have to count on the best in it. The minority political parties expressed their preference that the Governor himself, with the responsibility of the public position he occupies before the people of Puerto Rico, would be the one to judge him, and Continued on page 14 Leaders met with Judge Travieso Discussed common candidates of the opposition parties Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and candidate for Governor of the Socialist, Statehood and Reformist parties, attorney Martín Travieso, yesterday censured the leaders of the current Government of Puerto Rico, whom he accused of supplanting democracy with a totalitarian regime and of having perverted the principles on which Puerto Rican society has traditionally rested. Travieso said that he had abandoned the high office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to accept the candidacy for the governorship, which was his civic obligation, in view of the rampage that prevails in the Government of Puerto Rico and the disaster that threatens all the people of the Island. Mr. Travieso spoke at noon yesterday, before an audience that filled the assembly hall of the Ateneo. Mr. Traviesos words were received with great applause, by the members of numerous local committees of the Opposition parties, who were summoned to finalize the agreements on common candidacies of different municipalities. In addition to Mr. Travieso, the President of the Socialist Party, Senator Bolívar Pagán, the President of the Statehood Party, Mr. Celestino Iriarte, and the President of the Reformist Party, Mr. Santiago Iglesias Silva, spoke to the public. In the discussion of the agreements of the committees of the three Opposition parties, the maximum leaders of said parties intervened. In eata meeting, for being of private character, e did not allow the presence of lo journalists. It was noted, however, that all the discussions were conducted in a cordial manner, with a spirit of cooperation and personal disinterest reigning at all times. I The Creole Party will not be registered in the municipality of Aguas Buena, because an examination of the registration petitions made by the Executive Secretary, as reported yesterday, revealed that many of them, estimated at about 200, were defective and therefore null. The Cryo, lio Party speaks of 505 petitions submitted for Aguas Buenas. Meanwhile, the Executive Secretary is awaiting today an opinion from the Attorney General, aimed at  determining whether or not the candidacy of Mr. R, Fortuito Alvarez, for representative to the House for Caguas and Aguas Buenas, can be registered, since said candidate has been credited with a number of petitions for Caguas that covers the total required 1 for the representative district. Another issue  to be resolved later, according to what was said yesterday, is whether in case the candidacy of Mr. Fortufto Alvarez can be registered, the voters of Aguas Buenas could vote for her, since the Criollo Party will not be registered in said municipality. As soon as he found out about the situation, Mr. Fortufto Alvarez went to the offices of the Executive Secretary yesterday morning. He informed that he was requesting that the Attorney General resolve the legal issue involved as soon as possible, since the Creole Party only had until tomorrow, Sunday, to register the candidacy. He said that in case the opinion of the Attorney General was adverse to the Creole Party, said Party would immediately resort to the Court with a writ of mandamus, so that the candidacy be registered, considering that it had sufficient petitions from the municipality of Caguas.

December 16, 1927. J. PEÑA REYES. Secretary of the Insular Equestrian Commission Announcement. EUGENIO NOELS MASTERLY LECTURE WAS LISTENED TO Amidst a fervent silence at the end of the lecture, a delirious round of applause burst forth. . IV Almost completely full last night was the Teatro Alunicipal for the announced inference of the eminent Spanish novelist Eugenio Noel. Both the stalls and the double horseshoe of boxes, were, at the time set for the start of the event, overflowing with a very select audience, composed of prominent figures from núes tro literary and social world. The Columbia Universitys brilliant recognition of his mentality and of his magnificent work as a tribune and lecturer, which we extend to the country for honoring him as one of its preeminent sons. The old coliseum was graced by the presence of numerous ladies. It was a feast of the spirit full of sensation and brilliance. When the illustrious speaker appeared on the stage, he was greeted with a thunderous applause. Don Luis Llorens Torres made the presentation of rigor, extending in details on what represents our distinguished guest in the modern Hispanic mentality. With a warm emotion of conviction, the poet Llorens made the silhouette of the spirit of the race, immortal and invulnerable through the times. He spoke of the alternatives to which he had been subjected. When the budget for instruction was discussed at yesterdays hearing, Huyke asked for an increase of 1,845,858. Do you think it is prudent to grant this increase in a single year, Auditor Holcomb asked. Huyke requested that teachers be paid for 11 months of the year. In the office of the Auditor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Frederick G. Holcomb, the public hearing announced to discuss the budget of the Department of Public Instruction that will govern during the next fiscal year was held yesterday at two oclock in the afternoon. No one appeared at the hearing to oppose the increases requested by Commissioner Huyke in his Departments appropriations. The hearing was attended by Commissioner Huyke, the Deputy Commissioner and Secretary of the Department of Public Instruction, Mr. Martin, the General Superintendent of Rural Education, Mr. Pedro P. Arán, Mr. Ramón Alfartr and Mr. Harriman, and all argued in favor of the requested increases. The officers of the Department of Public Instruction, upon questions from Auditor Holcomb, stated that it was essentially indispensable to intensify education in the rural area of Puerto Rico, and that for this purpose they needed appropriations that would permit the realization of these purposes. -We need, said Mr. Huy ke, to develop in our fields complete systems of instruction, as well as in the towns. Gradually we have been establishing fifth gradQs in the rural areas of the country, then we have been able to establish sixth, seventh and eighth, but the latter are very- few. We cannot deny them a right to which the children of our countryside have been entitled. Mr. Auditor, President Coolidges statements to Congress on the deficiency of our rural education tell us that we must do something more for the children of our countryside. Commissioner Huyke requests in his proposed budget an increase in the salaries of the teachers and officers of his Department, corresponding to 1,665,000. The overall increase he is requesting over the current fiscal years budget, including salary increases and new appropriations, amounts to 1,845,858. Mr. Huyke requests that salaries be paid to teachers for eleven months of the year. Mr. Huyke further requests an appropriation of 50,000 for the support of night schools to teach illiterate adults to read and write; that the appropriation which existed two years ago be restored for the payment of 45 agricultural teachers, 45 teachers of physical culture, special teachers of sewing, embroidery, drawing and music. Requests that the appropriation for the purchase of books and materials be increased from the current 100,000 to 200,000. He requested one for the scientific equipment of the Central High School and for the purchase of new machines for the Commercial Course offered on that campus. Mr. Huyke recommends an increase in the salaries of the school inspectors and principals and also requests the creation of several positions in his department. Messrs. Martin and Aran argued extensively in favor of the increases requested by Mr. Huyke. The creation of new rural schools was another of the points discussed at yesterdays public hearing.

Mr. Tous Soto told us that he was perfectly calm and satisfied with his attitude. With regard to the telegrams of protest that he had received, he told us that he did not wish to say anything, that he left it to each one to adopt the position that best suited him and that everyone was free to think as they wished. He told us that perhaps this was because they had not fully understood the scope of this movement; but that in any case he recognized that everyone would be willing to support the ideas they had put forward. When we told him that we wished him to make some statement as to the reasons he had had for adopting this attitude, he replied that the reasons and motives he had had were explained in detail in the terms of the Manifesto itself. The meeting of the Territorial Committee did not want to tell us anything about the attitude that he would assume towards the Territorial Committee when it would take the decision to adopt such an attitude. The Committee will be held at the Territorial Committee when the Manifesto is raised there; but he did give us a telegram  to each and every one of the members composing the Territorial Co- -  tor - eírtófisuya  for the following Sunday, instead of tetabeartat as had been announced, on the following Sunday.

Yesterday our distinguished friend and illustrious comrade Mr. Mariano Abril, who was many years ago, Director of the same newspaper, and who worked all his life with the great patriot Mr. Luis Muñoz Rivera, was appointed Director of La Democracia. ! The appointment of our compmñero Abril must surely be well received by the island, by that thinking and patriotic island, by that discreet and talented island, which, when it sees a man rise, if he has merit and prestige, contributes to his triumph and his success. The name of Mr. Mariano Abril is as well known in Puerto Rico as that of Muñoz Rivera or Pepe de Diego. That is why his appointment to the leadership of our newspaper La Democracia has been very well accepted by all, by all those who carry in their hearts the feeling of Patria, the true idea of what it is, patriotism and hermapdad. Et MUNDO congratulates Mr. Abrí and wishes him magnificent success in his new position, to which he should have reached before, since he has enviable achievements and indisputable merits.

Yesterday we greeted in his office at the federation the Socialist leader, Mr. Iglesias, whom we asked if it was true that Mr. Reily was thinking of calling the Legislature into an extraordinary session. Mr. Iglesias could not assure us of anything concrete, as he told us that Mr. Heüy had not yet made any definite decision on the matter. However, we can report that the personal opinion of Mr. Iglesias, and therefore of all the leaders of the Federation, is that an extraordinary session of the Legislature should be called, since, according to what Iglesias told us, there are pending problems of such magnitude that only a special legislative session could resolve them. The matter of the island employees, particularly as far as the masters are concerned, says Mr. Iglesias, is something that demands the most prompt solution, and that must be solved no later than September, before the public schools are opened for the first time. Mr. Iglesias expressed himself in the most enthusiastic terms on this matter, emphasizing in his conversation that he is a strong supporter of the Legislature being convened as soon as possible, for which he will spare no effort of any kind. THE REPUBLICANS? Mr. Iglesias said he was not authorized to express the wishes of the Republicans on this matter; but he told us that his personal impressions on the matter were that the Republicans also wanted such an extraordinary session, since none of Silos was unaware of the serious problems currently facing the country. Mr. Iglesias concluded by telling us that his opinion is that all the poetic parties of the island are in agreement that the Legislature be convened as soon as possible.

THE TUG JOHN E. BERWIN After a long wait, and once all the commissions were assembled, on board the tug John E. Berwin, they all went to catch up with the Olympia as it entered the Morro. The following personalities, we remember among those who were aboard the John E. Berwin The Governor, Hon. E. Mont Reily, his military aide, Captain Lopez Antongiorgi, Ledo. Salvador Mestre, Ledo.

Accompanying said committees of the i Legislature, were the ari mas sergeants of both legislative bodies i  THE OLYMPIA ENTERS THE CANAL About five oclock in the afternoon made rti entry into the canal, the Olympia. She is an old model ship, with a draft of 21 feet, and on February 5th she celebrated her 27th anniversary of her launching. She was Admiral Deweys flagship during the Spanish-American War, and the floor of the main bridge is clearly marked where Admiral Dewey set foot when he was leading the naval battle of Cavite from the Olympia. On the stern there is a bronze plaque commemorating that feat. I I I THE FIRST SALUTES When she dropped anchor there was the Olympia and the coves were laid, the Legislatures committee boat was the first to approach the ship and the members of the Legislature were the first to board the ship. One editor, Muestro, jumped from the John Berwin to the Olympia before the rest of the party and was able to see the moment when the Ledo. Guerra Mondra- i gón was greeting Admiral Me CuUy, with whom he had a brief conversation and made the introductions of the other members of the commission. Upon being introduced to him by the President of the Senate, Mr. Barceló, the latter handed him an admirably prepared greeting message, the text of which read as follows To the Admiral of the Sea Guards Practice Squadron. Sir On behalf of the Legislature of Puerto Rico, we have the honor to offer you this message of cordial welcome on your happy arrival to our shores. Wishing to offer you a fraternal tribute of hospitality, the Senators and Representatives have decided to hold an informal session in your honor, and would like you to set a date for it during your stay in San Juan, in which you and your entourage could attend said session to be held in the morning, since it is our purpose to offer you also a luncheon in the halls of the Legislature.

Regarding - the request of the Legis- 1 lature he stated that he did not yet fit the  time at his disposal but that he would take the request of eHos  very much into account in order to comply with their wishes. I THE TIMES AND DAYS OF ON-BOARD VISITATION Before the Committee of the Legislature, the Admiral stated that the public would be able to visit the ship, which, although it was neither of the latest models, nor of a very high quality, was nevertheless of great historical value and said that the public would have access to the ship todayThat to the ship during the day today, Saturday, from one oclock in the afternoon until five oclock, and tomorrow, Sunday, from half past ten in the morning until five oclock in the afternoon except for the hour between twelve and one oclock noon which has been reserved for lunch for the ships crew. All day Monday the seamen will be engaged in supplying the ship with coal and the public will not be able to visit on board. THE GOVERNOR ON BOARD Accompanied by the Commission of the Chamber of Commerce and other important personalities, Governor Reily came on board, who offered his respects to the Admiral, whom he had already met on his trip to the island of Culebra. Accompanied by the Admiral and his military aide, the Governor looked over the entire ship. The same was done by the Legislative and Curatorial Commissions and other visitors. Admiral McCully went ashore at about six oclock, accompanied by the Governor and his entourage, and aboard the John E. Be twin. As he fanned the ship, the 17 regulation cannon shots were fired in honor of the Governor. Upon coming ashore in the Chief Executives automobile, 1 Admiral proceeded to the residence - of Mr. Aboy Jr. which is an where   he is to reside as long as he remains on . j the island.

THE OTHER FESTIVITIES As of this writing, we are not aware of any other changes in the program of the festivities, which is to be expected if one takes into account that the Admiral was informed of the program upon his arrival in this city.

Work on the Capitol suspended until next year. Yesterday we visited the Commissioner of the Interior, Mr. Wilson, in order to find out if it was true that the work on the Island Capitol had been suspended, as we had been told. Mr. Wilson answered in the affirmative, adding that he had ordered such suspension because of the expiration of the first contract with the construction engineer, Mr. Pons, under which contract the second floor of the building was almost finished. Mr. Wilson told us that because the plans for the second part of the Capitol were being prepared, work would probably not resume until early next year. This delay is due, according to Mr. Wilsen, to the difficulties encountered by the Department of the Interior in finding competent technical personnel to prepare the plans. The budget for the construction of the Capitol amounts to more than ONE MILLION DOLLARS. To date, more than 130,000 has been spent. The District Courts of San Juan, which at first were said to be established in the building, have lately been excluded. The Parliament and the Supreme Court, it appears, will be the only institutions to be installed there. in several states of the union the militia are mobilized washington, july 21. -In connection with the miners strike, which is becoming more and more intense, the Governors of several States of the Union have ordered the mobilization of the military forces to prevent any disturbance of public order.

Roberts WASHINGTON, April 1 PU-A State Department spokesman today forcefully told Russia that that nation has nothing to fear from the North Atlantic Security Pact unless it harbors aggressive designs itself. In reply to the indignant Moscow charge that the Pact-which is to be signed Monday-is a weapon of aggression prepared directly against Russia, he said that the Soviets themselves hold the key to peace. He added that the accusation was not aimed at creating confusion or uncertainty. Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, supported the statement. He said the alliance is a defensive step deemed necessary by the member nations because of past Soviet actions. Russia has no plans to attack any of these nations, Connally said, it need have no fear that the treaty will cause it harm. Only aggressors can have fears of the North Atlantic Pact. The Soviet quarrel was one of the major topics discussed in the continuing meetings between Secretary of State Dean G. Acheson and the foreign ministers of the other nations who are in this capital for the purpose of signing the treaty. Acheson met this morning with French Foreign Minister Robert L. Schuman and Belgian Premier and Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak. He spoke of meeting again with Schuman and also conferring with British Foreign Secretary Ernost Bovln. At a luncheon hosted by the National Press Club, Bovln said that a fundamental principle of the Pact is that we will never descend to aggression. To potential aggressors it says Think twice. The last war would not have happened if the aggressors had had to face an equal organization. He says to totalitarianism You have your alaterna. We have to share your world. But dont harbor the idea that you can subvert the face of the world. At a question-and-answer forum, the British statesman said he did not know whether Stalin was a prisoner of the Polltburo Soviet Political Bureau. The mysteries of the Kremlin, Bovln said, are as imponotreble to me as they are to the alert American Press. Bovln said that history will consider the signing of the Pact the point on which mankind took its greatest step toward the proclamation of the great freedoms of the world. He indicated the convenience of an attitude of calm in relation to the prepositions tending to the creation of a Pacific Pact, saying that we would like to see first the definitive congroslonal action on this the Atlantic Pact. He used the occasion to defend a 38,000,000 trade treaty with Russia, saying that such a treaty was in line with the decisions of the Economic Cooperation Administration. We believe, Bovin declared, that the exclusion of the Iron Curtain kickers from all contacts in the West was not the wisest course of action to curb the retaliation. There are millions of people in many countries who are anxious to see the curtain lifted and  Cont on page 31, Col. 3 Hoover Commission Recommends Total Liquidation of PRRA Would Use Pitts Plan, Which Davis Says Is Impossible. Interior Decides to Continue Agency by PAUL HARRISON WASHINGTON, April 1. PU-The Hoover Commission today recommended that the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration PRRA be liquidated, and that its remaining functions be placed in the hands of other federal agencies. The Commission recommended the adoption of the so-called Pitts Plan of Pons Investigates Soda In Arecibo Orders Sample To Be Taken Before Students For Alleged Rum Use The Health Commissioner, Dr. Juqn A. Pons, instructed the Department of Healths Bureau of Sanitation and Food to proceed with an investigation of the soda made from ice cream, rum and raisins, which is sold in Arecibo to the public and schoolchildren. Some day ago, the school children of classroom 2 of the fifth grade of the Franklin D Roosevelt School of said city, sent a communication to the Commissioner of Health explaining that since a long time ago, a soft drink prepared with ice cream, milk, rum and raisins has been sold in Arecibo to the children of this community. The schoolchildren asked if the small amount of rum that they say this soft drink contains is harmful to the children. A Community Problem They went on to inform Dr. Pons that in our Community Problems class, we are trying to study the above problem. Questioned yesterday about the Arecibo school childrens letter, Dr. Pons said that he has requested an investigation to the Bureau of Sanitation and Food, so that samples of the product in question can be taken to determine the amount of rum it contains. The Health Commissioner said that based on the chemical analysis of the product, it will be possible to clearly determine what the ingredients are. He also said he was interested in being informed by the Bureau of Sanitation Cont. on page 14.- Col. 8. The settlement, approved in July 1947 by the Secretary of the Interior, J. A. Krug. However, the director of the Territorial Division, James P. Davis, told the United Press that the operation of the plan had proved impossible. He stated that the Department has therefore rescinded for the time being its intention to liquidate PRRA, and will continue to administer it. The Commission made no recommendation regarding the Virgin Islands Company. However, in a report on federal business enterprises in general, it proposed a series of reforms. The recommendations include the adoption of a uniform statute for all Government business corporations; the conversion of all Government business enterprises into corporations; and the elimination of duplicity in their foundations. Pittas recommendations The Pian Pltts plan for the PRRA was made by Malcolm E. Pltts. who after making a comprehensive study recommended its liquidation. Pltts recommended 1.

Last Zafra Announces U.S. Army Will Buy Some 500,000 Tons HAVANA, April 1, PU- Cuba will have no trouble selling its entire 1949 sugar crop at four cents or more, but its marketing problems will become much more difficult in a few hundred years, according to a study by John L. Forbes, of the brokerage firm of the U.S. Army. Forbes, of the brokerage firm of Merrill, Lynch, Pierece, Fenner and Beane. Forbes told the Press last night that there will be a surplus of about half a million long tons at the end of this year. pqro that the same will be easily placed on the market before the 1980 crop is available. Forbes added that the future of the Cuban economy depends on harvesting four to four and a half million long tons in the next few years. He stated that the 1948 crop will be about five million - possibly less - compared to the more than six million tons of 1947, and added that the 1949 crop was estimated at four to four and a half million long tons. Sugar Requirements Forbes stated that the U.S. Armys sugar requirements for the occupation zones will approach three hundred thousand long tons this year, but said the Army will buy half a million or more long tons. He warned that the United States - surrounded by a quota barrier - would no longer allow the continuation of prices which do not stimulate sugar production in the U.S. territorial areas.

Cunningham WASHINGTON, April 1 PU - Lawyers for two Puerto Rican refiners today asked the U.S. Supreme Court to force Congress to stop passing laws they say fatten metropolitan refineries at the expense of Puerto Rico. The refining companies, Con- tral Rolg and Western Sugar, said they freely admit that Congress has great power to regulate commerce between Puerto Rico and the states. But they said it has no right to arbitrarily discriminate against Puerto Rico, as it clumsily did with the Sugar Act of 1948. Their attorney, Frederick P. Loo, made these allegations in a petition filed with the Supreme Court for a ruling on the constitutionality of the 1948 Sugar Act.  Howard C. Westbrook. Donald Hiss and Daniel M. Gribbon, on behalf of the metropolitan refiners, filed briefs to the contrary, alleging that such a decision is unnecessary. According to the Sugar Law, Puerto Rico could sell a total amount of 1,023,753,000 tons of sugar. According to the Sugar Act, Puerto Rico could sell a quantity of 1,023,756 tons of sugar per year to the metropolis. Congress provided that only a subquota of 128,033 tons - or about 12.3 percent of the total - could be used for refined sugar. Unfair Quota The Puerto Rico Government says this is unfair, which is why it brought the matter to a court controversy last year over the division of the 1948 subquota between the various Puerto Rican refiners. Rolg and Western were trying to prove that they had not received a fair share of the subquota. The Court of Appeals in November upheld the Puerto Rican refiners arguments. For procedural reasons, it ruled that a decision on the issue of constitutionality was unnecessary. Both the Government of Puerto Rico and the Secretary appealed to the Supreme Court. The Island Government asked the Court to decide whether or not the Congrooo could impose what amounted to a limit on the amount of sugar the Island could refine.

The atecra Healer and Progressive Party candidate for vleapr- fSl-B- VWWW U.S. Presidency was sentenced to 180 days in jail and fined 50 when a Birmingham Circuit Court jury found him guilty of disorderly conduct last May.

Group That Goes Around the World in Bergantín Arrives in San Juan For BENJAMIN SANTANA Editor of EL MUNDO In an adventurous voyage around the world, twenty intrepid North American sailors arrived in San Juan yesterday. Seventeen months after leaving Gloucester, Massachusetts, in an old German brig. The Yankee, a former sailing ship used by the Germans in 1912 as a rescue boat, sailed out of the harbor on November 2, 194, having already completed its circumnavigation of the five great seas. The crew is composed of four women, a child and 15 shoulders that one day decided to suspend their school studies and set sail on one of the most picturesque and daring enterprises. They wanted to know, from their own experience, everything they had read in textbooks about the different races and cultures of the East and the West. They also wanted to see, with their own eyes, the places of famine and desolation resulting from the horrible world conflagration of the past. One of the young navigators, Engineer Alan Pierce, tells us, Engineer Alan Pierce, tells us that the idea of doing the Via Je came spontaneously. They had heard about the adventures of Captain Irving Johnson, who had circumnavigated the world four times, and they also wanted to experience the thrills of such a round-the-world voyage. After several calls, visits and conversations, in a few days they had already made the necessary arrangements for the trip, each contributing the modest sum of 4,880. On November 1, 1947, at exactly 200 p.m., they hoisted sail at the port of Gloueeater, Massachusetts, and set sail for the first port of Cape Haiti. Commanding the Yankee, which has pratenuions of resembling Christopher Columbus Santi Maria, is Captain Johnson, who is accompanied on the voyage by his wife and Robert, an eleven-year-old son. Other members of the officer corps are Stephen Johnson, senior pilot, Ja?k Braidwood, second pilot, Frank Power, senior pilot, and Alan Pierce, engineer.

Two members of the Popular majority in the House, Representative Alfonso Román García, of Fajardo, and Miss María Líber- . tad G6mez, of Utuado, yesterday made serious denunciations against public schools. Rep. Román García said, addressing the House, that the school at the rate we are going is corrupting in its integral and moral part. Mr. Román Garcías harsh comment came after Repesentant Gómez, while arguing in favor of House Bill 683, which strictly prohibits 1 holding halls and banquets in es- . She said she was ashamed of the unpleasant spectacle she had witnessed at a school graduation in a school in a neighborhood of Utuado, where liquor and ballroom dancing had been consumed in a way that was not an edifying example for the children or for the citizens. Ix Which Provides The bill of Miss Gómez, which was approved on third reading, provides that when a Superintendent of Schools has knowledge of any infraction of this law in his school district, said official shall notify the Commissioner of Instruction, who in turn shall request from the Attorney General the appointment of a prosecutor to prosecute the offenders before the courts. The bill provides that excluded from 1the prohibitions it establishes are the activities carried out by schoolchildren under the direction of their teachers as part of the act of teaching. The violation of this law shall be considered a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not to exceed 35. About sixty employees have been left out of the House. The budget of the House, according to the bill approved yesterday on third reading, amounted to 120,459.38, and the same will be in effect until June 30, 1949, when the budget for the next fiscal year will take effect. The largest portion of the budget approved yesterday is for the payment of salaries to the representatives. The amount of 329,250 is appropriated for this purpose, to pay the salaries for three months. The bill also provides that the remainder of the House of Representatives appropriation, Without Dl trihuir, For Operating Expenses in the amount of 328,491.82, contained in Act No. 280. approved on May 15, and the funds set aside for the House of Representatives from the appropriation contained in Act No. 2, approved on April 11, 1948, which have not been expended or purchased, shall be paid into the general funds of the Island Treasury. With the savings proposed in the bill approved yesterday, the Chambers expenditures for the fiscal year 1948-49 will total 262,395. The bill contains a provision to make the bill effective March 18, 1949. -The House also approved an appropriation of 650,000, to be expended by the Emergency War Program for public works. The amount of 50,000, of the referred appropriation, will be used by the Emergency War Program acting on behalf of the Department of Labor to carry out tasks related to the shipment of Puerto Rican workers to the mainland.

MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS ISLAND ARE NOT EASY TO CONDENSE IN A FEW WORDS LUIS ARAQUISTAIN M A comment on his incident with Mr. Huyke. Ideas on the fringe of the Spanish literary movement. At half past four in the afternoon, the time at which Araquistain had arranged to meet us, we set off for the Palace Hotel. We thought, as we walked the short distance between our editorial office and the hotel, that we would have to wait another half hour to see what was announced and the illustrious journalist decided to receive us. Useless worry. Araquistain, standing at the threshold of the door of the Palace facing Tetuan, was amusing himself by observing the picturesque and heterogeneous street life. No doubt, like any man of mental action, he likes to alternate work with observation, which is also the work of analysis. The old secular street is sometimes roared up by the electric streetcar. At other times, it is a car speeding by. All these people passing by on foot, and in vehicles of different categories, look at us curiously, sadly. Eyes of a woman, they were tying us in their escape from the windows of the cars and through the grill of the streetcar, while they mumble a name. -Araquistain. There is Aracuistain. We enter the interior of the hotel. We are already comfortably seated in springy leather armchairs. In the half-light of the lobby we observe this man and remember his works where he poured all the light of his complex spirit. Seen thus, in this clean environment of li. NOTICE M OVER PAYMENT OF.

Here we are, Mr. Araquistain, without rigid questionnaires, without premeditated intentions, exclusively guided by the purpose of chatting with you for a while and knowing your latest impressions of Puerto Rico, -we tell you. My impressions of this island, -he replies- are not easy to condense in a few words. I have written and continue to write a number of articles which I send to El Sol of Madrid, in which I speak of the things I have seen and heard during my stay in Puerto Rico. They have already begun to be published and I believe they will soon be read here. In them are my emotions as a visitor, my observations as a writer and my criteria about what is the present and what will be the future of this country. It is interesting, very interesting, the evolutionary process that is verified in all aspects of Puerto Rican life. From the slight analysis that I have been able to carry out, I deduce that you are living at the present time in a moment of indecision and complete disorientation as to the path that you must follow as a people. This disorientation, this multiplicity of criteria, I have been able to observe it in meetings I have attended.

What engineer Ortega does not say to that effect. With reference  certain widening works which the Department of the Interior intends to carry  out on Ponce de Leon Avenue, we interviewed Engineer Mr. arique Ortega, who gave us the following data   - For some time the Department of the Interior has been negotiating with the national authorities in Washington the acquisition of a parcel of land in Puerta de Tierra, in front of the properties of the Military Reserve and the Weather Bureau, in order to continue with the work of the Ponce de Leon Avenue, corresponding to 1 San Juan-Rio Piedras Highway.  The Honorable Calvin Coolidge, President of the United States, by means of Proclamation No. 1781, dated August 24, 1926, transferred and conveyed in favor of the People of Puerto Rico a strip, with an approximate area of 576.38 square meters, of the land of the Military Reserve, and another with an approximate area of 529.38 square meters, of the property of the Weather Bureau.  The proclamation specifies that these ceded lands will be used exclusively and finally as part of the widened avenue and the Pue  blo of Puerto Rico commits itself to build an honor wall to protect the federal lands, and a fence with as many entrances and gates as may be necessary for easy transit to the offices established there. The work to be carried out for the widening consists essentially of increasing the limits of the avenue to 10 feet. Two concrete sidewalks, each two and a half meters wide, with its eorrespoddienta speed bump and curb will be óonstruídas, leaving a space for affirming free rolling of 15 meters, which will be asphalted just as the rest that is in use for some time. The need for this widening is being felt more and more every day.

SAN JUSTO 4 AND 6 IODO ALEEN STREET COMMERCE AGAINST THE ALTERATION OF THE ENTRANCE AND EXIT ROADS TO SAN JOAN. Knowing that a protest had arisen among the commerce of Alien Street against the projected alteration of the routes of entrance and exit to this capital, we visited the well-known merchant, Mr. José Andreu, member of the protest committee that has been formed, who made the following statements -Truly, that in Puerto Rico, we have the misfortune of not studying the issues in depth, because only studying the sections of the Puerto Rico Automobile Law gives a basis for not proposing the change that the Police want. In its section 12, the automobile law clearly states that vehicles in traffic must stop on the right, and you will understand that if the traffic is diverted on San Francisco Street and the trolley goes up that same street, walking on the right, as the road is today, entering the street, one could not stop on the right and would necessarily have to stop on the left, which is contrary to the law. The only way this change could be made without legal conflict would be to amend the automobile law, in the sense of stopping cars on the left. This would bring the corresponding conflict, not only in traffic, but in the manufacture of automobiles coming to Puerto Rico, which would have to come with the guides on the right.  Besides, as you know, curves are strong enemies of automobiles and the traffic in front of the Casino would have two curves of more than 45 percent to overcome, when - today we have in the San Juan one nothing more than a deviation of 3 percent. The protest of the merchants on Alien Street, representing more than FIVE -MIL NES OF DOLLARS- invested, is powerful, and we propose to vi because of the continued increase of traffic, and that is why the Department has taken so much interest in acquiring from the Federal Government the parcels indicated. Work will begin shortly. CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES OF PUERTO RICO M - NOTICE .

Governor Towner delivered the following address yesterday at the ceremonies held in the Plaza of Columbus, on the occasion of the anniversary of the discovery of Puerto Rico I have to speak to-day in these commemorative exercises, on the four hundred and thirty-third anniversary of the discovery of Puerto Rico, by Christopher Columbus. Under the shadow of his monument, I must speak to you of that great man who gave history a new world, perhaps the greatest and most heroic of human deeds. Under our beautiful national flag, and on the only ground sheltered by that on which the Great Discoverer never set foot, I shall recall to you some of the incidents of that momentous event and some of the characteristic features of that great figure of history. The dark scenic background against which the mighty figures of the fifteenth century stand out is that strange, mysterious and almost unknown period called the Middle Ages. For a thousand years it seemed that the world remained stationary. Progress, education and instruction seemed lost in the fierce vortex that drew nations into incessant and devastating wars.
