IRONIES OF FATALITY w Alberto Cruz, Disdier, teacher ' dy English in Gurabo, had the misfortune to kill, while trying to clean a revolver, the one who gave him the ser. ' The fact occurred in Rio Grande. The unhappy lady, who was ill in the canjpo, was taken by Cruz Disdie? to the town, in order to take her to the hospital. Cruz's brother gave her a revolver to clean, after having extracted, as he told Alberto, one by one all the bullets. Fatally, as usually happens in these cases, a bullet was left behind, which was the one that caused the tragedy, and pierced the chest of the happy lady, who died immediately. The prosecutor, Mr. Diaz, Collazo. eoni convinced that it was a fatalistic accident that caused the death, ordered the proceedings to be closed.
