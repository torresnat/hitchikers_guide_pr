Of íes attacked by the plague one died and the other is serious.
Yesterday morning died at the Cuarentenario hospital Mrs. America Rodriguez, who was admitted to the Cuarentenario, together with Gregorio Hachon, both as suspected cases of bubonic plague. These two cases were brought to Cuarentenario from Caguas, where there have been recent reports of rivers. The laboratory has confirmed these two cases as positive for B. Pestis. According to infrmes, the last one, Bachón, was extremely serious yesterday afternoon, and a fatal outcome was expected. The alarm in Caguas is growing by the minute and the Health Department is not slacking in its active sanitation campaign. THE "UNION OBRERA CENTRAL AND " THE " ECONOMIC COMMITTEE '' V In the last meeting held by the "Unión Obrera Central" several speakers talked about "the economic situation and the industrial crisis" of the country. ■ These gentlemen said that the banks have closed their credits, both to farmers and industrialists, and that the latter have nothing to work with, so that bankruptcies are often registered..... And among other things they expressed that the legislature wanting to lessen that crisis that for the current economic year have caused the Banks with their attitude of closing the credits enacted several laws of public improvements to provide work to the working class and peasants who are the most harmed, appointing an economic commission of five members of the House and six of the Senate to study the problem and solve it and that the economic Commission met twice in a row and last president Barcelódió-erden to suspend the sessions indefinitely.

Freight rebate made does not include PIo.Rico sugar.
Yesterday we exchanged impressions with Mr. Nadal of the "N. Y. and P. R. R. S. S. Co.", regarding the rebate in the new freight rate. Mr. Nadal informed us that the aforementioned reduction in freight rates would begin to take effect on or about the 23rd of the current month. The rate that is now going to undergo this ten percent reduction, which is a positive benefit to the public, is the 1917 rate, which was in effect before the United States entered the war, and which during the international conflict was not increased by a single cent. It is necessary," says Mr. Nadal, "that it be understood that the reduction of the tariff only refers to general cargo: provisions, merchandise, etc.... Sugar, for example, does not fall under the previous classification and will continue to pay the same rate as now, that is, 32 cents per quintal. The other day," adds Mr. Nadal, "a newspaper published information to the effect that in trade with the United States the ports which paid the highest freight rates were those of Puer- ! to Rico. Mr. Nadal showed us a list of what all the ports of the Antilles pay in freight rates. These were lower numbers for the ports of the island. WARD LINE SHIPS Regarding the information published in a San Juan newspaper that the Ward Line ships would call at San Juan, Mr. Nadal, who is the representative of that line here, informed us that to date he has no news that the Company plans to establish San Juan as one of the ports for the route of its steamers between New Orleans and Spain..... But that in any case he would do all in his power to see that such a plan was realized.

The replacement of Ledo.- José Coll y Cuchí will be appointed from jin moment to jin moment.
On the occasion of Ja previso | r measure adopted by the Leca authorities, suspending the demonstration that was to take place today, the spirits that seemed very excited on that occasion have been calming down little by little, and now only occasionally you can hear some rumors, The news that we published yesterday concerning the sending of a letter to investigate the private lives of prominent Unionist leaders, has produced an enormous impression on public opinion, which has received it with great displeasure, considering that it is a measure not only arbitrary, but also arbitrary.This "measure is not only arbitrary but unjust. The news published yesterday by "El Tiempo" that a political banquet had been held at Mr. Mestre's residence, attended, among others, by Mr. Córdova Davila and Mr. Barceló, is absolutely false, as Mr. Mestre himself informed us yesterday. Mr. Barceló was not in San Juan and therefore could not attend the aforementioned banquet. What happened was that Mr. Córdova Dávila was invited to lunch by Mr. Mestre, and when he was seen arriving at the latter's residence by Mr. Pietrantoni, a prominent member of the Republican minority in the Municipal Assembly, it occurred to him to take advantage of his unexpected discovery by playing a joke, a very ingenious one indeed, on his "El Tiempo" newspaper colleagues. The Governor assures us that he is considering many names for the position of President of the Workers' Compensation Commission, and today the nomination will probably be made, with the most certain person indicated to occupy this position being Ledo. Celestino Marrero, Clerk of the District Court of San Juan, First District This recommendation was made by Ledo. Félix Córdova Dávila, not having been able to make a better selection, Mr. Marrero is conockli capacity and honesty in the performance of his public duties. In connection with this appointment, an editor found yesterday the Socialist Senator Mr. Iglesias, in the Governor's office, while he was writing a note to the Governor, recommending Mr. Eduardo Salcuña, Executive Undersecretary, for this position. Our Editor, who was already aware of the appointment made by the Governor in favor of Mr. Marrero, warned Mr. Iglesias, who, nevertheless, left him a note on Mr. Reily's desk THE AUDITOR'S RESIGNATION IS NOT CERTAIN Last night we telephoned Mr. Bonner, the Auditor, to inform him of the appointment.
Mr. Bonner, the Auditor, with the object of having him confirm the rumor published yesterday that he had resigned his office because of disagreements between him and the Governor, and we were informed by Mr. Bonner that the rumor was untrue and that there has been no difference between him and Mr. Reily. CROSS LETTERS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND MR. COLL ♦ VIDAL On the occasion of the vacancy occurring in the presidency of the Commission of In. demnízacones to Obreros, Mr. Reily, yesterday addressed the ¿guíente letter to Mr. Coll y Vidal, of said Commission, it being curious to observe that in the address of the same Mr. Governor suppresses the name of the editor of "La Democracia".

The Captain will visit the Governor on Monday, before taking possession of his post.
that yesterday I addressed to Mr. José Coll y Cuchí, ex-President of the Workers' Compensation Commission, the following letter and "San Juan, August 11, 1921.

cXVISO Once again a propaganda has appeared in the various towns where we support tobacco factories, insinuating that our Company could accept the intervention of a third party to settle the difficulties that a certain element still claims to exist between the workers and the Company. We emphatically declare that the conflict which we were forced to accept at the time has been settled, since we have had all the personnel necessary to meet the present demand for our products for some weeks now. Therefore, we do not accept that we can be forced to enter into further discussions on the matter. We repeat what we have already said on several occasions: that we will respect and fulfill to the letter the commitments we have made and no operator need fear that other operators could take away the position he currently occupies.

THE RESURGENCE OF RELIGIOUS IDEAS AFTER THE WAR HELPS THE MONARCHICAL CAMPAIGN (UNIVERSAL SERVICE) PARIS, August 6.-A definite monarchical movement has been started with the object of restoring the house of Orleans to the throne of France, initiated by a proclamation issued by Prince Philippe d'Orleans, which appeared posted on all the walls of Paris, and by a banquet of prominent royalists in the same city. The pretender to the throne, Duke of Orleans, declared in his manifesto, launched from his castle in England: "At a time when France has lavished her blood, sees her public treasury ruined, her northern and eastern provinces desolated, it is right that legitimate preparation should be received for her damages after the victory, but the present regime of France has shown its incapacity and cannot even enforce the concluded treaty. "History repeats itself. No good government is possible in France without a permanent leader. The country, realizing this at last, is returning to the truth. "It may be said that very shortly occasion will present itself for the French people to test whether they have confidence in their present government. "When the people wish it, with God's grace, I shall be ready to do my duty." It is asserted in very well-informed circles that the royalist sentiment is greatly increased in the French provinces, particularly in the devastated regions of the north and in the extreme south. It is claimed, however, that the south of France favors the pretensions of Prince Napoleon Ponaparte to the throne and that it does not lend its supporters to recognize the Bourbon legitimists. The religious revival so evident throughout the country and which has been officially sanctioned by the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Holy Silk, contributes not a little to the rise of the monarchist ideas which are said to be publicly supported tacitly by the principal military chiefs who secured the triumph, such as Marshals Foch and Petain.
