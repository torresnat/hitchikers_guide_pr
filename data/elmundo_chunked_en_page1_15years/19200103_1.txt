THE PREMIERE OF THE NEW PLAY DEIEROI5AM This evening the new play by nnw.r" dear colleague in the press José Pérez Losada, entitled 'La Vida es Acida, o las ind.'. trias de: prohibicionismo ' ' ' By staging this play the' notable author seems to want to initiate the exploitation of a modern lauj theatrical genre: the "vaudeville-^ so widespread in Europe and in the United States. The ■■ vaudeville' ' is an advantage over the comedy that we call of entanglement or comic situations, even though its action is somewhat dislocated and therefore requires a great deal of slowness to succeed. Tér?z Losada, who knows the audience's psir -ln? a, will succeed as always with the presentation of his latest work, because his lack of talent and knowledge of the theater's seere'os make him a resounding triumph. Our esteemed and admired cor. pañero continues to lay in a firm way the stable foundations of the regional theater, lavishing with full hands the inexhaustible treasure of his wit.
