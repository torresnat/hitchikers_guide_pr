I was a Judge of the Court of Appeals in 1898 until April 24, 1909, when I became President of the same Court, which I still hold. From the year 1874 until the cessation of Spanish sovereignty I served in Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines for a period of 24 years. It is my intention today to resign the office of Chief Justice of this Supreme Court and for this purpose I come to your Excellency with the request that you admit my resignation to take effect on January 9, 1922, when the first term of the Court begins in said year. Most respectfully, José C. HERNANDEZ 1 WHITE HOUSE.
