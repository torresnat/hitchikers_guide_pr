What he says about the pact le ronce P. Rivera Martinez Motivated by the news circulated yesterday that an official pact had been made between Republicans and Socialists, we got in touch with important politicians of the Southern city, who assured us that the pact verified is Republican-Republican; that everything is reduced to a stratagem' of the Ledo. Tons Soto to discourage the; ' Unionist hosts. They are of the opinion in Ponce ¡ ■ that the Unionists who belonged to the ! Union of Puerto Rico will not accept any arrangement with those who were their enemies. To verify these reports we went to the general offices of the Socialist Party, and Don Prudencio Rivera Martínez, candidate for Washington, informed us that they, the Socialists, did not know that any pact had been verified, and that the leadership of the party is opposed to that kind of business. The Socialists," he told us, "will go alone in the struggle. We accept the votes they want to give us; but you can be sure that we will not give votes to anyone who is not a Socialist. The Republicans proposed to accept my name for Resident Commissioner in exchange for certain concessions and we have not accepted.* Don Rafael Alonso, Secretary General of the Socialist Party, who was present, confirmed the statements of Rivera Martinez, and assured us that the Socialists alone had sufficient forces to carry a number of S^eettrtzntes* and Senators whose cooperation in the Legislature would be indispensable. Pacéos with Unionists and Republicans, there are not and will not be. Our party, by its nature, cannot make any kind of transaction with parties that try to deceive and tyrannize the people. Rivera Martinez and Alonso speak as people determined not to compromise or make any kind of compromises with anyone who does not belong to the Socialist party. POLITICAL REPORTER. Vicente Blasco Ibáfiez, author of the '"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse", has been routed to a duel to the death by General Juan Barragán, Chief of Staff of General' Venustiano Carranza, who has made a formal promise to follow Blasco Ibé&ez to the end of the world to engage him in a duel. - General Barragan, who is in Mueva Turk, greatly mortified by the articles of Blasco Ibañez" about Mexico, and in which the distinguished author of "Entre Naranjos" acerbically called the young General Barragan, effeminate and handsome, intends to leave at any moment for Spain, where he believes he will meet the senior Blasco Ibañez.

MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED YESTERDAY THE MILI-i TAB PARADE AT THE MORBO. i The great military parade held yesterday at the Morro field in honor of the Commander and officers of the battleship "Alfonso XIII" was impressive for its splendor and brilliance. An immense, numerous crowd invaded the grounds ¡ 1 of the Castle and the adjacent walls and bastions. It is estimated that there were more; । than 10,000 "persons and about 500 > 1 automobiles. THE COMMANDER. At five o'clock arrived the commander of the "Alfonso XIII," Mr. Gon ' zález Billón, accompanied by the Vice-Cón-; sul of Spain, who occupied the seat of honor assigned to them. With them were some officers of the "Alfonso XIII", the representatives to the Chamber, Messrs. Guerra y Coll and Cu-! chí and Messrs. González Beltrán and Trigo. THE PARADE At half past five o'clock the । parade began. All the Companies > of the Regiment were present, as well as the various military organizations belonging to the Regimental forces. THE OFFICERS. | The .officers commanding the Compa- ' nies, who were warmly congratulated j by the Commander of the 'Alfonso XIII', have been, in the first* term, Colonel Mr. Marvis, Major Nadal, Lieutenant-Coronad Griffith, Military Adjutant Mr. Emmannrili, and Officers Mteoo Vázquezi Rupia, Olivar, L^ez AntoMgñngi, Rodríguez and Urrutia. " AN AIRPLANE. While the parade was taking place, the public was surprised by the nest of an airplane flying at high altitude. The aerial craft was maneuvering over the Morro compo, disappearing suddenly. This airplane was manned by the aviator Mr. Aubert and belongs to our friend Don Santiago Panzardi. THE PARADE At about a quarter past six o'clock the parade began. At the exit of the Commander, Mr. González BiUón, together with the Consul Mr. Serrano and Mr. Trigo^ was the object of a sympathetic homage. The crowd broke into a round of applause, which lasted until the distinguished sailor left the Morro grounds. THE BISHOP AND THE SEMINA- # # ' EIBTSAS. The ceremony was attended by Bishop Jones and the students of the Conciliar Seminary. We also saw the Attorney General, Mr. Rivera Baya* and other authorities. At 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, you will fly Don Rafael Martí. ... M first Puerto Rican aviator will ' rise in Hato Rey, in the airplane i of Br.

ladies of San Juan and representatives of the Spanish Colony. AT THE -HOTEL MEL1A ' The distinguished visitors for being i Spaniards have aroused in the al- ' mas of these Ponce inhabitants j i romantic resonances, and thus ex- ■ ' plicate the enormous enthusiasm with which ' they were received. The sailors of the Ab ' tongo XIII, so fine and so kind ( have won in the areas of our hearts the deepest sympathies and have found a shuddering echo. For all this, and much more ' í than that, the people of Ponce, always ' ; gallant and generous, have rendered them more than regal honors. i The officers of the Alfonso XIII moved immediately to the splendid Hotel Melia, where a magnificent banquet had been prepared. The officers and the representatives of the Spanish Colony and social centers of the city were seated around large tables. The banque < j te, which was presided over by the Comisio- ! j nado de Servicio Púb'ico, having at ! ¡ the right the Sub-Commander of the * Alíon-fo XIII, was offered by the es pañoles of Ponce, to the oficíales of the I excellent Spanish battleshipI The judge of the District Court, i señor Sepúlveda, was appointed toait- ' I - * * * -Jm; ' - I - I . master. * Before giving pririjjio to ios diseqr I sos, the Sob-comandarte of the ' XIII read them; nteye* of eH "jrttel, ; the* which stood. qnm, to } one,. ^ntter the "íma "iteiés IBmEU J ■' cas of the immense crowd. THE SPEECHES , > ' The first words of Judge ! Sepulveda were of praise and ho- i ; menage to the officers of the Alfonso ¡ ' XIII. He stated that the banquet was ■ | a glorious confirmation of the treaty i i i of spiritual peace between Spain and the j ! United States. He said that this act , í signified an affectionate embrace between ' King Don Alfonso and the President of I í the Republic- , Then he spoke, the I * commissioner of Public Service, se- ' i ñor Del Valle. His speech was a can ! í í tb to Spain and a tribute to the ra- I I za- He said that the Spanish sentiment , I is rooted in our hearts i í and that flag of Spain, was the j j same glorious as always, respected ■ and blessed by all portorrii queños. The Ledo. Martinez Nadal had deep affection for Spain and for the sailors of the battleship Alfonso XIII. He stated that the rupture between Puerto Rico and Spain had been merely a political rupture and not a spiritual rupture. In more or less analogous phrases, Father Garcia, who was also very applauded, expressed himself. Don Antonio Alvarez "Nava, who accompanied the officers from San Juan, took a turn in the speeches. He spoke very eloquently1 Judge Sepúlveda replied to his manifestations, in patriotic paragraphs. Finally, the Sub-Cotnan-' dante of the Alfonso X1IÍ spoke. When the distinguished sailor rose, he was greeted with a standing ovation. He read a dinenr so thanking the people of Pon 1 ce and stating that Puerto Rico, 1 with being so small, gi ngríftei mente, [ is, nevertheless, a whole Ciaitinrntr, 1 for you feeling and for you "wanón. * ¡ The words of the illustrious sailor i í were received with mue "t*rt of rio cuente approval by ok pdHico.
