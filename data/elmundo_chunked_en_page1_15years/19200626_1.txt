Today, June 24, 1920, this case was called for trial, the District Attorney appearing in repruratáoión of He^Pueblo de Puerto Rico, and* the defendants sn personas and assisted by their attorney Mr. Cayetano Coll Cuqhí. A roll call was taken of the jurors summoned to appear. JUDGE Q, Are there any cases pending for today? A. Prosecutor * In this case 3081, The People of Fuer to Ricd v. Johann ^ubbe f Federico Stubbe and Arturo Trias, the Prosecutor requests the dismissal of the case as it relates to Arturo Trias and Federico Stubbe because this case has been seen, before the Jury * are the same facts, and the Prosecutor respectfully complies with the resolution of the Jury of San Juan which fortunately rarely errs. At the same time as for all the other cases we request the dismissal, because I understand that no crime of those imputed to these defendants constitutes such an offense, apart from the information of experts that we have related to the alleged falsifications and certain accounting errors that do not constitute in any way the crime of falsification.

It decided also, that Germany supplies 11 manpower for the destruction of aeronautical material, as pre seen in the Treaty. The various Tra-! fates will be officially communicated to' the neutral nations. PARIS, June 25.- reply to the. German note asking the Allies; to reduce their army to 200,000 ho^ ■ bres was renü'ida this morning to the German De- ' legation. Believe that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France has told Mayer, German Chargé d'Affaires in Paris, that the Government of the Republic intends to appoint Charles Laurqnt, first honorary president of the Court of Auditors, as ambassador to Berlin. Two notes were sent today by the Secretary of the Peace Conference to Goeppert, President of the German Delegation, concerning the non-compliance with the military clauses provided for in the Treaty of Versailles. The first particular concerns the destruction of war materiel and the necessity for the adoption of legislation in A lema nia on the military clauses concerning conscription into the army. The second particular refers to the aeronautical clauses. It communicates that! Germany will be able to build her aeronautical material three months after the destruction or delivery of her existing material. The Secretary of the Conferences also sent to the Grand Vizier, Damaart Fe rid Pacha* a note informing him that the time limit granted to Turkey for lodging objections to the Treaty expires tomorrow.

Simons, German Foreign Secretary, has told the correspondent of "Le Matin" that Franco-German economic collaboration is indispensable for the development of the two countries.

The of ¡ bOíafe by, ¡ Illas colorantes.
The theory that diseases can be cured by color waves was expounded and developed by Dr. Dinshah B. Gadiahll, of New Vnrh, । last Tuesday at the session held by the Allied Medical Association of America, held at the Pennsylvania Hospital. "Light is as necessary to the human body as food," said the aforementioned Dr. Ghadia, "The solar lux is composed of seven colors and each of the beings of creation shows a preponderance of one of them. | The potency of an element depends on the potency of its coloring rays," he added, "Foods and medicines are composed of specific elements and act in accordance with the luminous potency of their coloring rays. The human body is made up of these same elements or combination of colors. It contains: approximately 9.1 percent hydrogen, 13.4 percent carbon, 2.5 percent nitrogen and 72 percent oxygen. The colors that dominate the light waves of these four elements are red, yellow, green and blue respectively. Thus these four elements contribute 97 percent to the formation of the human body and the power of its four color waves depends on them. In a normal or healthy state, these four colors are perfectly balanced in quantity. The loss of this balance is the cause of illness. The reestablishment of this balance, providing the necessary color or reducing the surplus, returns to health". He further stated that drugs could be reduced to their potential and could thus be administered to cure disease. He maintained that the primary colors of the solar spectrum were not red, yellow and blue as has been maintained, but that they are the only ones that combined can give white. He said that the effect of quinine in reducing fever is due to the action of the blue waves that compose it.
