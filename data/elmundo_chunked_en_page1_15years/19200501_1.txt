dAmr tanteé te developed on the nnw'-Mb Eme Antonio a serious event, which pflllr hilarte,, poet the lives of several of Mr J¡|blüiihr. 'de S worked aboard ^L¿yiaFDtr 'Eterno", docked at that ' dock. AFTER THE CRIME Jose Cardona is a mulatto residing at Puerta de Tierra. He is a dock worker.... But now he is not working, due to the present strike. As Cardona does not work for that reason neither does Cardona want the others to work.... And he has been, since the strike broke out, watching to see that this principle is not violated. The employment of workers from the island, by the shipping houses, for the work on the docks, went down very badly with Cardona, and he took a plan* to use the revolver!..., which he put into practice yesterday afternoon, thus: . He found himself a dinghy, in which he placed himself, armed with a revolver. Pushed by his passion BOL- ¡ CHEVIKE, Cardona rowed, until he reached the dock of San Antonio. To ' ATRACAR, he looked for the end. Once there, he climbed up on the parapet of the pier and pulled out his revolver. -j -Shut up!..., If you don't let me shoot I'll kill you," replied the handsome man..... (They say that the guard then let him do it... It was about the rogue...). Cardona took advantage of that moment.... He fired several shots at the laborers working aboard the "Coamo''. Fortunately, he did not manage to wound anyone; they all escaped the bull. Lo<r-proyectiles.'',fbte<m " ü "r crustarse qn'mqa of the' walls of the eáitete?

I WANTED TO FINISH THE JIBAROS Detectives Alvarado, Paganacci and Suarez set out in search of the fugitive. They returned with him shortly thereafter. When the prisoner was questioned in our presence, he said that he was going to finish off all those jibaros who had come from the island to break the strike. -If I had had a bomb, I would have used it too," said the man. ALARM AND SKIRTS Huge crowds gathered in the airedores of the wharf. Some approved of the stunt; others condemned it. * A great number of women gathered there.... And it was to see how they discussed. How well they commented... ... . -That's the way to do it, they said. Those are the ones we need. With men like that, you can go anywhere. Long live the strike! We also heard that the poor guard who was on duty there was suspended from his job.

1 Communication with the planet Mars might be possible.
* They say da Omaha, state of Nebras- ► ka. that on the 22nd signals from the planet Mars were expected there ►, and that for this purpose Dr. Frederick E. Mi- ► llener. an expert in telegraphy malam J brica naria to operate an electric- ' tric system installed in the last few days in ' all the territory of Nebraska, with the > aid of telegraph wire used co i. mo antennas. t Dr. Miilener established during the war a wireless telephone system in Che- ► sapeakc Bay, and his reputation in that field is very considerable. It is believed that if the Federal authorities permit, Dr. David Todd will establish communication with Mars by means of apparatus installed on a balloon to be commanded by Captain Stevens, with Omaha as his base of operations. The said professor was expected in that city from Washington. Dr. Millener has stated, in connection with his experiments, that in order to obtain a message from another planet it is necessary to rely on an analogous field of communication or thought. "On earth," he says, "we know of the movements and action of the various planets, and that knowledge is to us of mathematical precision. If the other planets are inhabited, their inhabitants, if they know of the earth as we know of their respective worlds, will have an equal knowledge of the motions of this star. "All the planets move in a regular and mathematical manner. So. . then, in the exact sciences, we have with them a common point, even though the mathematics may be con : ceived and interpreted in a dis <98ta "ótterMMrá*rpo! t lettej । The form of existence may be ' of conditions not imagined by us ■ others. But two and two are four, as i to on Earth as on Mars. I "All these planets throw re ¡ fleja or direct light. The spectrum of each of these bodies has already been studied. It is. therefore, not an absurdity to : gine that with the knowledge of their j spectra and of their light waves, vij Sible or invisible, efforts can be made to obtain communications < al through interplanetary space by means of such waves. It was published that the Marconi company had ma nifested that it had received before anyone else special signals which ,it could not explain. ' "Every wireless signal is the ma1 nifestation of a visible m ■ light wave, but of a definite intensity in its vibration.  | The "I ¡ nd of the Earth's surface can be intercepted by means ¡ of radiographic apparatus."
