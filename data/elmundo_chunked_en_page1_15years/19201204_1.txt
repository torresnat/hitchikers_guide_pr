The price of sugar will never go to $20, but neither will it go below $8.
Yesterday we visited in his office on Fortaleza Street, Mr. Nicolas Hernandez, a well-known businessman and main partner of the important commercial firm of this plaza, Nicolas Hernandez and Co. Given the current situation of the sugar market, we asked Mr. Hernandez, an expert in these matters, for some information on the subject. Our distinguished friend gladly agreed to our request, and he was pleased with what we asked for. SUGAR WILL NOT DECREASE FROM 88 -What do you think of the price of sugar -we asked Mr. Hernandez. He replied, "I do not believe that the fabulous price of $20 will be obtained, but neither, in my opinion, will it fall below $8, and I base my opinion, among other reasons, on the following: I have just toured most of the United States and have found several abnormalities and especially the enormous reduction in the natural consumption of sugar. One of the major houses of New Orleans sent one of its partners to Central and South America to buy enormous quantities of black sugar in blocks of that which we call here "ca ramelo" and elsewhere "papelón", distributed among the candy manufacturers who used it in their manufactures. As for candy factories, the consumption of Bon Mon, the weakness of the American woman, was reduced considerably, since the prices were enormous, and for $1 a box of candy was half of what was previously bought for the same price, which means a reduction of fifty percent of the consumption. Popular restaurants such as ¡

i of Thompson, etc., which had by eos 3 tamp to let the public help themselves to sugar established 1 the serving of coffee already sweetened which ro duced consumption. The restaurants of higher catego. 1 ry brought sugar in small sachets, or cubes, but always limiting the amount. The American housewife, who was in the habit of preserving fruit, greatly reduced this practice because of the exorbitant price of sugar, and in California I saw that fifty per cent of the fruit packing houses did not work last year because they did not buy sugar at a convenient price, and even those that did pack did so only for the orders they had accepted and at open prices, to protect themselves against speculative increases. The fruit that in other years was packed was used to make the so-called "ore jones. The public ice cream stands, fresh produce, etc., served their products in seasoning. The expected development of soft drinks or sua. ves, never came because of the prices of candy, and instead the breweries introduced their in ' alcoholic beers, which will lose their popularity the day that soft drinks and other beverages can have the sweetness of candy. I more beverages can have the sweet ne ■ cess it. Even in Cuba, a sugar-producing place, many guesthouses have primed their coffee, and others serve it already sweetened, using the least amount of sugar possible. I believe that everything will return to normal. That consumption will return to what it was, and yes, it is true that we won't be able to mirror it. I (Continued from page 3a.)

War against D'Annunzio to begin next Tuesday.
FRENCH CABLE l FIUME, Dec. 3.-Military intervention by the Italian Government against D'Annunzio's legionaries is considered imminent, judging from an orlen of General Caviglia, commander of the regular troops of Italy in the vicinity of Flume. In one of the -paragraphs of the referred oiden, General Caviglia says that the conflict against D Annunzio is inevitable if the latter continues to assume a bellicose attitude and of rigorous opposition to the Government. The General told the representatives of the press that the regular troops will withdraw from the vicinity of Fiume, provided that D'Annunzio observes a peaceful and moderate attitude. The distinguished military officer adds that in the feared conflict the country needs the cooperation of all Italians and hopes that no difficulties of any kind will arise. The dispatches received at the last minute say that, according to the newspapers of Rome, the Italian Government has officially informed the allied nations of the conflict.

The new president of Cuba, Don Alfredo Zayas was imprisoned in Madrid.
As readers know, the illustrious president of Cuba, Don Alfredo Zayas, was born in Havana in 1861. He graduated in Law in 1883, and soon became an enthusiastic and skillful politician. A strong supporter of autonomy, he was a member of the so-called autonomous party in 1895. In that year he joined the revolutionary party, and was one of the most active agents of the pa, triotas that, captained by Máviu. > Gómez and Maceo, fought in the nía. niguas. In 1896, Zayas was captured by the Spanish authorities, who disputed his deportation to the Peninsula. He was taken, in elect, to Spain and entered in the Model Prison, of Madrid, where he remained until, condemned to several years of imprisonment, he was transferred to the prison of Ceuta to serve the sentence When the war ended and the independence of Cuba was declared, Zayas was freed and was reintegrated to Cuba, in whose politics he intervened of a decisive inane ra, to count on a great mass of supporters, especially in.
