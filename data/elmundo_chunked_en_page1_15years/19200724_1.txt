Talking to the alleged accomplices of "Ghuchu".
Yesterday afternoon a reporter from EL MUNDO visited the Presidio, who spoke with the alleged accomplices of "Chuchu", Francisco Davila and Jose Cartagena. The two accused are in the galleys of summary proceedings. Our reporter requested permission to speak to the prosos. It was granted. A prison guard brought them to the presence of the representative of EL MUNDO, who was waiting in the warden's office. FRANCISCO DAVILA. Davila resides in Bayamon. He used to work on a farm that his father owns in the jurisdiction of Guaynabo. He is a young man, of frank appearance. He wears dark pants and white shirt, i . -It's a hot afternoon! -we say to him as we sa. i ludarlo. Dávila n^da says. -Do you want to tell me something for the press? (I don't know what it's all about! -From.... Why were you arrested? ! -I don't know myself. I don't know the crime of which I am accused. -They accuse you of having helped ' --Chuchu" to evade justice. i -All I can say is that I have never seen that boy. He was i in Bayamon at the time of his misdeeds but ' nothing else . -What bail has been set for him? -$20,000. My family is already making arrangements to lend it. -Do you think you'll come out well in this matter? -Surely. My conscience is clear, as I have done nothing! * Dávila is apparently serene. | He speaks little. Almost in monosyllables. His eyes look at us with distrust. Lúe- j go, he gives us some indications. i -We will say what you said. Nothing more. JOSE CARTAGENA JMe - el-oteo. He is also young and more communicative than the first. He says he knew "Chuchu," but has never had any relations of any kind with him. -When was he arrested? -Yesterday. The Bayamón police. They set the same bail as the others, $20,000. -When "Chuchu" killed the policeman, where were you? -I was in Comerío. I arrived two days later in Bayamón. -What are they accusing you of? -I don't know. That's for the prosecutor to know. Cartagena tells the story of "Chu-¡ chú". He says that he was a barber, "chauf-i feur", etc. As for his friendship with him, he denies that he ever helped him in any way. Dr. Herbert Watson, Delaware State Chemist, has informed Judge Hastings that fermented milk contains three per cent. of alcohol, and that, therefore, some dealers should be prosecuted. Long before prohibition this drink was a favorite of bar-goers, who consumed it with relish.
