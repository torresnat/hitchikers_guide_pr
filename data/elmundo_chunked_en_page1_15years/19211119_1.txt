What Ido. Rivera says about the Muñoz monument.
Speaking with Rev. Fr. Dávila, one of those most interested in the erection of a monument, in the cemetery of Barranquitas, to perpetuate the memory of) Puerto Rican patrician Luis Muñoz Bi ▼era, he made the following statements in relation to the work they propose to carry out to achieve that purpose: * 'At the last minute I received news that the Commission in charge of raising funds to erect a monument to Mu fio" Rivera, will meet within a few days, with the purpose of deciding to resume the work of collecting said funds and adopt the necessary agreements in relation to the selection of the site, plans and works of the same. I intend to go out promptly on behalf of the board, for the purpose of calling on the local committees to do the collection and at the same time take charge of the funds that are in the possession of some of the committees." * In Barranquitas, on the fifteenth day of the present, and at the residence of Mr. Giorgetti, a meeting was held, with the attendance of Messrs. Bar, Abril, the priests Torres, Dávila, Rivera and Lebrón; Don José G. Torres, Coll and Vidal, Dr. A. Ruis Soler, F. L. Amadeo, Antonio and José Ruiz Soler and Lic. Antonio R. Barceló, agreeing to resume the campaign in that sense, to gather sufficient funds in all the island, so that in the celebration of the sixth anniversary of the death of the hero, the monument can be ready, v the reforms of the cemetery of Barranquitas, of the square and the mausoleum.

Huyke appointed for a new term Attorney Quiñones.
Yesterday morning visited La Fortaleza the attorney Quiñones, prosecutor of Guayama, whose term as such official expires today, as our readers may know. Mr. Quiñones conferred briefly with the Acting Governor, and the latter stated that he had the pleasure of informing him that he-Quiñones-would be appointed for a new term of four years, to continue occupying the office of Prosecutor of the Guayama Court. Yesterday afternoon the appointment was issued to Mr. Quiñones, who left shortly thereafter for Guayama. According to our reports, there have been many people who have gone to La Fortaleza to indispose Mr. Quiñones, accusing him of using his office for unionist politics. Everything seems to indicate that the charges did not stand up to the Governor's investigation, so he has done justice to Mr. Quiñones, appointing him for a new term. As we understand it, the license of Torres Cordova, who was appointed by Governor Roily to occupy the position of prosecutor of Guayama, will continue to act as municipal judge in Ponce, unless further dispositions do not indicate otherwise. ELECTRIC CAR KILLS A MAN Yesterday, at 11:30 a.m., near the "Martin Peña" bridge, electric car No. 14, driven by motorist Luis Piñero, going in the direction of Rio Piedras, ran over the elderly man Venta ra Rodriguez, causing him serious injuries, from which he died at the "Puerto Rico" Sanatorium. The Hon. District Attorney made the corresponding investigation. Gentlemen Owners of FORD Gomas Royal Cord 30 x 3 1 1[2 - The U.

The Acting Governor, Hon. Juan B.

WHAT FRANCE AND ENGLAND ARE ASKING FOR AT THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE (From our correspondent in N. Y.) VIA "ALL AMERICA CABLES" WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.-The French Do legates have asked that the question of land disarmament be discussed as soon as possible. In this connection France asks to be allowed to have an army of 1,800,000 men, which she considers indispensable to insure herself against all danger. Lloyd George bi ordered to suspend work on the 4 large battleships being built in the English shipyards. How much is his name worth? Positively, the value of a trade name is in relation to the profit that can be obtained from it.

Unionists have raised more than $15,000 for the campaign.
Yesterday afternoon we were informed by a distinguished politician of this capital, that the Union of Puerto Rico had raised to date more than $15,000 to defray the expenses of the Commission that is going to Washington. The well-known politician informed us that it was necessary to continue the subscription to raise a very large sum to cover not only the expenses of the Commission but also others of equal importance. To date," added the gentleman alluded to, "many towns on the island have paid the assigned quota, but on the other hand there are others that have not. What we want," he said, "is for the whole island to respond like San Juan and Ponce, since there are many wealthy people living in some of the second-tier towns, who can help us in our purposes. After saying goodbye to our interlocutor, we met Don Antonio R. Barceló, who told us that to date everything was going perfectly. "About the subscription," he added, "I only ask that whoever has five silk shirts, sell one to contribute to the greater success of our program. .k ONE PASSENGER KILLED AND TWO WOUNDED in an automobile accident, from Isabela yesterday we received the following telegraphic dispatch, in which we are informed of a serious automobile accident which occurred between that town and the town of Quebradlllaz: Isabela, November 18, 1921.
