Yesterday at about half past two o'clock in the morning, the P.1297 mining car, driven by the chauffeur Federico Mhu, ' lina, ran over the twelve-year-old boy Emilio Infante, causing his death a few moments later, i , From the investigations carried out by the Municipal Judge William J- San 'tos. it appears that at the time the boy tried to get out of the back of the P.905 car, x that was coming from the place called "Puerta de San Juan" to the Presidio, he did it with such bad luck that although Molina, who was coming in the opposite direction, made all the efforts he could, he was unable to avoid the unfortunate accident at Socan's Hall. When the child Infante was taken by the same automobile to the emergency room, he had not yet atoned. Practitioner Alers put all the means at his disposal to save him from death. I i i varié of death, but everything was - useless, because he died immediately- ' Were eyewitnesses Arturo Abril, Julio Ram : rez Quiñones, Jacin. I to A. Ramirez, Regino Ortiz. Federico C- Lopez and Domingo *G. Rivera. The boy received strong contusions, but the one that caused his death was a strong contusion over his heart - ' TODAY ARRIVES THE - -CLBAN STARS' It is expected that today morning the players who make up the Cuban Stars will arrive. - In any case, the first challenge with the Cubans will be verified this afternoon, at stop eight.

I carvings of alloholic beverages deposited in that Department, the proce- ; dents of all the smuggling sorted out by him and his assistants. i -i And what do you intend to do with such a rich treasure? 1 - We are awaiting orders from Washington to proceed with the sale of those beverages, which in the opinion of a medical expert, to be appointed in due course by the Federal Court, serve for medicinal purposes. The purchasers, of course, will have to be pharmacists. The sale will be by auction. -What price do you intend to put on the lot? j -That depends on the inventory. i You know we have all kinds of drinks there. Whisky, Bran, dy, Bacardi, Gin, Marie-rissard, Anisette, etc., etc., even Champagne. -It's all right, Mr. Siegmund. Look, I've got a mouthful of water in my mouth. Don't go on. I understand. You - you will adjust a price for each drink, according to its quality, and then, it's worth the lot! -That's right. -Then we'll have the thing fluctuate between ^4,000 or $5,000. -That'sJ " -Not estfm^l. But those that are not used for medicinal purposes, expensive, etc.? -Those, the-destruireipos. -It's possible, man! I protest! I'll protest?

i ■ ■ , ' ■ Don José B?nedícto summoned the employees of the Department of the Interior to an assembly, which was held in the courtyard of the Intendencia, । and spoke to them about the advisability of joining and buying shares in the "Asociación Constructora Jel Hogar" i Djjoles that the purpose they had pursued in forming this association was that the employees would have an easy means of acquiring their homes. The Governor spoke for 30 minutes- After he had finished speaking, Mr. Molina spoke, and said that all the employees should have faith in Mr. Benedicto's statements, because he had always shown great interest in the work of the association. He said that he had always shown great interest in helping the employees, "Right now," said Mr. Molina, "we have on the table the question of the increase of salaries, and I, who know closely the actions of our honorable Governor, can affirm to you, that if from our honorable Governor, he will be able to help the employees," said Mr. Molina, "he will be able to help them. After Mr. Molina spoke, Mr. Moore spoke, and invited the employees to cooperate in the progress of the satiety, because in that way they would soon be able to obtain houses of their own. The proceedings concluded at one o'clock in the afternoon. LAZARO.

An Ingenious Machine for Testing Automobile Tires.
' /' . . . . 'i l T n simple but efficient method of testing the adhesion between the treads and the filler bands of all rubber, as well as the adhesion between the layers of ply and cords, is that used by the I "Mason Tire and Rubber Col'*, of Kent, Ohio, in addition to the usual tests on the roads - ¡ A machine driven by a mo. | tw. guÚMda mu two pernee <le sidewalk cppstruccióñ esfammL| sóbre' ía"''chales are molifica) gom^ 'pa'ta pjóeba Lás'^ mas gifá$ eú cóRt^elú eon Tas féfs xjúe tieheu p©r point Se I epntaéfo c<íu U góña, di^ntek de próxi^iiuc^te dn'cuatr i de pulga^¿s.

miles. They are then cut into sections to check the eon ditions of the various layers. It has been repeatedly shown that if a rubber withstands this test without any sign of separation of threads, bands, etc., it will go down the road without any separation, until it is completely worn out. It should be clearly understood that this test is not done to demonstrate the hardness and wear of the tread, but to demonstrate the adhesion between the various plies that go into the manufacture of our tires. Wear from sand, skin, rock or similar road conditions is the only test of the strength and hardness of the tread. This is obtained on test wheels, running ; continuously day and night, on । all types of roads- ! The tires rotate in the endurance testing machines under a pressure of approximately seven hundred pounds*. This is equivalent to the average weight received by each car, so that the machine comes very close to the conditions on the road, as far as the weight received by the gbu^i is concerned. This is only one, among ■ many other methods of testing ' emiole by the "MA^ON TIRE J AND WjBBER CO-, to demonstrate the.paleness of its rubbers, andj?á¿ í í be sure^ without doubt, I that etfas represent uniformity ¡ in the manufacture superiority fie the masters such employed.
