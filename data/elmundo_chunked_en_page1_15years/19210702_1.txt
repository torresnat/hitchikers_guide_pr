U. & U. THE TERRIBLE FIGHT THAT THE TWO TITANE81IBRABAN TODAY.
(FROM THE NEOYORK PRESS) Few events have moved the aims of this town as the coming fight between Georges Carpentier and Jack Dempsey. The Yankee spirit is absolutely sporting. If bullfighting were ever acclimated in this country, the fans would number in the millions. The passion for athletes is, after the great love for business, the master of every American heart. Dempsey, naturally, is paid here tributes of Olympic god. His words are already acquiring the sound and solemn fame of proverbs. The giant fighter's face appears in all the newspapers, and in homes it occupies the place of honor next to the meager figure of General Pershing. The Yankees, generously, forgive him the ▼ida * Carpentier. There are some who believe him to be so inept that he does not even deserve the honors of being placed in front of the "lion of Colorado". He is criticized because he goes to theaters dressed in tails and receives journalists in luxurious silk pajamas. His rooms look more like those of an artist! than those of an ordinary boxer. And that's because the tragic Oran Boa.

Carpentier sees in boxing, a resurrection ■ of the classical age: a return to 1* 1 Greece of Aspasia and Pericles. -1 Carpentier not as he does :. Dempsey: for profit only,. The proof of this disinterest is in his refusal to allow the public to see him practice, which deprives him of earning a sum of not less than sixty thousand dollars. Dempsey, on the contrary, has turned his gymnasium into a public square. Carpentier feels for boxing with the enthusiasm of a man with an idea of lysia. For him, boxing is not about making money, but about fulfilling his aspirations and holding his name high. s| A boxing chronicler who visited Carpentier recently said: "I don't understand how this pale-faced, almost effeminate boy has the courage to challenge Dempsey. I am almost certain that this fight > will not last more than five minutes. - Before the second "round" Dempsey > (will knock Carpentier to the ground." But Sullivan and Willy Lewis, two boi xeadores of fame, are of the opinion that the triumph - will be Carpentier's; that Dempsey has never ! met a boxer of Carpentier's agility and intelligence. Sullivan said, "The case of Dempsey and Carpentier is the same as that of Sullivan and Corbett. No one expected Corbert to hold out even three minutes against the giant Sullivan, and you see how Corbett, less strong than his opponent, managed to put him out of the fight. Laugh at the size of Dempsey. Carpentier will beat him and in an almost embarrassing way...." (Continued on p. 6) Buttons are pressed and lined. A CARA7O, Brau St 72. Advt.

The tobacco of the country has no morcco because of its'orecios.
Mr. E. H. Davis, business-manager of the leading tobacco newspaper, the United States Tobacco Journal, spoke to one of our editors yesterday and told us that he has come to the country to make a study of the state of the tobacco industry in the country and to give the tobacco companies such information as may be of benefit, as he has done in Cuba, where he was recently. Mr. Davis' mission is to travel all over the world, commissioned by the newspaper, which is paying all his expenses. Of Cuba, Mr. Davis told us that the tobacco crop is small this year, because only those who have enough money have been able to plant. As for Puerto Rico, he stated that several tobacco buyers had arrived in the country from the most important tobacco houses in the North, with the purpose of making purchases; but that due to the high prices demanded for the article, it had not been possible for them to conclude any operation, having to return to the North again empty-handed.He added, moreover, that in the North, all the tobacco-growing States have lowered their prices, and although that of Puerto Rico, he says, is of better quality than that of the other States, it should proceed in the same way, lowering the price proportionately, and, of course, extending this reduction to the tobacco workers, as has been done in the United States. Mr. Davis is in touch with all the industrialists of that branch in the country, with whom he has been conferring all these days. He will remain on the island for several weeks, at the end of which time he will return to New York with his family, who are accompanying him. Yesterday morning he left for the island, via the central highway, for the purpose of visiting the tobacco-growing areas of the country. On his return he promised to give us ample details of his impressions there. MORE CONGRATULATIONS TO THE LIUDO. CAPO (BY TELEGRAPH) Cataño, July 1. EL MUNDO, San Juan.

Elre&ltaldsl Tuesday at the Theater
As readers know, the notable concert pianist Don José Conrado Tovar, headed by the enthusiastic gentleman Don Celio Rossy, "amaI teur" and pianist of merit, although his great modesty is the enemy of display, ue¿ and praise, will give on Tuesday, as El Mundo has already said, at half past eight o'clock in the evening, a great concert at the Teatro de la Reina Sofia. | The concert promises to be a true artistic event, not only for the talent of the distinguished pianist, but also for the value of the people who will contribute to the splendor of the event. | Don José Conradt" Tovar is not a pianist performing sedamenfe. He is, in addition, what we could call a psychologist 1 V/* ' v * 3 of music, because he knows how to unravel all the arcana of harmony and emotion that the pages of the great composers treasure. In order that the public may appreciate that he is a true pianist, we are pleased to reproduce, in synthesis, the phrases that some very important newspapers have dedicated to him: From the "Herald", London: "Tovar, the Mexican Paderewski, gave a recital last night in the Beethoven Hall, before a very select audience who gave him repeated ovations. Mr. Tovar plays well, with brilliance and feeling. The Chopin hummers were masterfully played, with intense passion." From the "New York New York Tribune": "Tovar is a credit to his country, his art and himself". And from the "San Luis Daily": "No one should look for in Tovar that poetic intimacy, those who feel in music, mystical and exalted voices; his sonorous discourse is simple, direct, uncomplicated, and his style, not at all polychrome, sometimes gives the impression of a strong water". ,

A CRIMINAL CANNOT BE ACCUSED MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE SAME CRIME A motion will be heard today before Judge Odlin, of the Federal Court, by John Gay, representing Cecilio Miranda, for the Court to acquit him freely, since in the jury trial held against this defendant, the jury, through an error in the preparation of the verdict, found a different person guilty of the crime and not the aforementioned defendant. It is alleged that the defendant cannot be retried, because this violates the precepts of the statute of limitations that an offender may not be indicted more than once for the same offense.

(By French Cable) New York, July 1.-It has caused an enormous sensation in boxing circles, the news that the formi dable champion francs Carpentier has not ! put up any obstacle to fight ■ in a space of 18 square feet i proposed by the American boxer Demsey.

The petition of the superintendent of reforms not to hold the challenge GENERAL STENGER BEFORE THE LEIPZIG COURT LEIPZIG, July 1.-The Supreme Court of this city has begun the trial of General Stenger, accused of having ordered his troops to kill prisoners. The aforesaid general denies the allegations, but Major Crusius, who in nineteen hundred and fourteen years ago gave orders to Stenger, has made very serious statements, which, because of their truthfulness, are the subject of outbursts of anger and many commentators. Major Crusius says that before the battle of Neuchoff, General Stanger assembled the officers and ordered them to kill all the prisoners. He further cites numerous instances of death being applied to wounded soldiers. Despite these statements, Stenger continues to deny the facts. Dr. Farnau, who assisted Major Crusius on the field, says that the latter's state of nervous depression was due to the orders given by Stenger that all prisoners were to be put to the sword, which resulted in horrific scenes. ' The Berlin newspapers were indignant at Crusius' statements.
