".-ft | 1 Distinpid people traveling on the 'Antonio Lopez'.
On Thursday the liner "Antonio Lopes" arrived from Spain, which we visited yesterday afternoon. On board we met distinguished persons, among whom we remember: DON ANTONIO MABTIN BIVEEO. Mr. A. Martin Bivero is the Minister of Cuba in Boma, where he has been representing his country for some years. Martin Bivero has held other important positions in the Cuban Government. He has been in France and Germany for several years, in official positions, all of them with the approval of his Government. Mr. Martin is going to Havana on leave, DON LUX"' JORGE SANCHEZ* K second officer on board, Mr. Boig, introduced us to a young gentleman, with a pleasant appearance. He was Don Luis Jorge Sanchez, attached to the Legation and Ctendller of the Colombian Consulate in Cadiz. The diplomat extended his hand to us, affectionately. -What is the purpose of your trip," we asked him, "I am coming to America on private business. -At what port did you embark? -In Barcelona; but, as I have already told you, my residence is in Cadiz. -Have you held other diplomatic posts in your Government? -No, sir. This is my first. I have held it for a year now. -Do you plan to return to Spain soon? -Within a year, after I settle some business concerning my possessions in Colombia. -Are you rich, then? -I have something. (Here my friend Boig told me the rtato). -I think so! Don't ask him that. He is very rich. I have it on good authority). CAELOS LUNA. Luna turned out to be the most intense guy aboard the "Antonio López". He travels confusedly among the passage, a bit mixed, third-rate. He dresses poorly. Chocolate cashmere jacket and vest. Drill pants. No collar. His shirt is poor. -What is his profession? we ask him. -I am a painter and sculptor. -On a trip? -To Havana. -Are you hired to do some work? -No, sir. I'm going aimlessly. -Besides painting and sculpture, what else do you like? -Literature. I remember that once I took a play of mine to Benavente, "El Supremo Juez, la conciencia", and Don Jacinto said he liked it very much, let's say, he spoke to me enthusiastically about it! In i view of this, I asked him to give me his approval, since I had seen it so much (Cantinea on the third page), and he had made the following statements in Havana; । 't-Estrada Cabrera, in these last* aflea was completely lacking in dataMsto; *"a tiran" of the worst es-, i pede. It is not possible to release him because he would be a danger to our country. 8* life is not in danger, but his Uberi toó is, and. for a long, long time.

Betances's ashes in New York ।
' a, The remains of the distinguished Borininefio were the object of high and deserved honors triboados by the Authorities and the Colón" Portorriqueña.
(From Our Correspondent) . On the morning of the seventeenth of June, Gonzalo O'Neill, president of the "Asociación Portorrique-' ña' ', received a wireless message from aboard the steamer "Francia''* addressed to him by Deputy Alfonso Lastra-Charriez, commissioned by the L^ialatnra of Puerto Bico to go to France and bring to our country the remains of Bamón Emeteriq Betances. The message to which we refer came con- - ceived in the following terms: "GONZALO O'NEILL, New York, j I will arrive Saturday in the 'France' with cení zas Betances. Hold dock for me. Urgent.- LASTRA ". On the evening of Friday eighteen-eight the "Puerto Rican Association", created to strengthen the ties of trust between all the children of Puerto Rico residing in the United States, gave a reception in the halls of the "WaldorfkAstferia" as a tribute of respect and affection to the Representative of our country in Washington. Mr. O'Neill made known, on such an opportune occasion, to the persons there assembled, the message he had received,' and at the proposal of Mr. Córdova Dávi!a a a Commission was appointed to r*Q^ ' bir to the L^isladór who had gone on such an honorable mission to fulfill. Upon the arrival of the ship, the ashes of the procqr were taken to the residence of the distinguished comijMríota Dr. Julio J. Henna. On the following day, the Committee met to take the necessary actions so that honors could be paid to those who remained on their last journey to their beloved land. Gonzalo O'Neill took the floor and stated that if Puerto Bico had made "Decoration Day" a holiday to honor the memory of the great continentals who with their glorious deeds had exalted their homeland, the City of New York should, as a reward that should not be avoided, pay homage to the distinguished Puerto Rican patriot. At the direction of Mr. O'NeÜl and with the concurrence of those present, a committee was appointed to request from the civil and military authorities of New York City what, according to Mr. O'Neill, was rightfully due to *1 indefatigable defender of the liberties of our people. The following persons were appointed to form this Committee: Gonzalo O'Neill, Dr. Julio J. Henna, Felipe Tabóada, Edward J. McGoldrick, (Brrence E. F*r-> guson, Arthur K.

Congressman Lastra then spoke, ratifying the well-deserved concepts expressed by Dr. Henna about Betances. Mr. Tabeada, evoking the memories of the work carried out with deep enthusiasm by the great patriot portorriMpño for the crystallization of the ideas of liberation that animated the Cuban soul, supported on behalf of his government the request of that Committee. Mr. O'Nera gave Mr. Mayor, on behalf of the "Puerto Rican Association", as President of the same, and on behalf of the Commissioner Rí "id "na^'en Wanhingtof whom he represented on that occasion, the most expressive thanks for the benevolence un "hri^m - dirafifl*ed to the ©<►-. mité by acceding to the* request made to him.

Thousands* and thousands of cratinataates, with the ashes uncovered* and deeply moved, witnessed that demonstration that was made in honor of the Puerto Rican whose name "grogio" has been recognized by 1* goddess of fame at the pantheon of history. I Referring to* * this solemn ceremo- : nil, a New York newspaper* says: "For* every Puerto Rican, the name of Retrilw Emetario Betances is an echo ' that s* eye with vcxration.

Dr. Raíz Stier, informing him that the Board at one of its last sessions had agreed to build, and donate, a hut k 1 e' Insular Sanatorium for the children. Don Rafael Fabián, the worthy president of the learned society of reference, expressed his desire to contribute half of the sum that the building would cost. Very soon the work will begin, in which about 33,000 at least will be invested. This generous trait of the distinguished gentlemen who compose the Board of Directors of the Spanish Casino, seconded by the other no less distinguished and enthusiastic members of this association, which has so often proved to be inspired by the purest and most altruistic feelings, is worthy of the highest commendation and the support of all. So, then, the number. Dr. Ruiz Soler has begged us to make public his gratitude for such an important donation.
