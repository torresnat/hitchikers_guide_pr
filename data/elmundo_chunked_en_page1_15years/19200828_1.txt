THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE ▲ THE AMERICANS The Legislative Chambers of Venezuela - adds Mr. Aubert - presented a bill with the purpose of eliminating the Canadian and American banks operating in the country, with the purpose of obliging the citizens of the United States not to intervene in the economic life of the nation.

| The lowering of prices was conti-! ! made in the North
The decrease in exports to Europe, owing to the diminution of purchasing power there, has been the cause of a reduction in the prices of certain articles in all the markets of New York, and the con '! ditions are such that a general reduction is expected in the entire line. ! However, the factor pointed out is not ! considered as the only determinan ' । t, especially with respect to those ar i denlos which have no world circulation ! dial I would attribute the decline in prices in this respect to the super- ■ i cation, or rather, to the extraordina i ry production both agricultural cqqmo ma ! The only items which it is believed will not yet be lowered are steel and corn. The price of sugar at 21 centa : ves a pound is but the sign of the i decrease which is soon to be seen in ■ the price of the article. Vegetables of all kinds, especially potatoes and onions, have i down considerably. i Grains have dropped from 36 to 60 I per cent of the high price they were ; in 1919. Rice, especially, due to the lack of orders from abroad, as well ' ' ' as from the large quantities put into circulation by the British government, has fallen by 40 per cent. This has also been contributed to by the production already circulating in the U.S. market. Despite all this, very few articles have so far reached their pre-war prices, although some dealers admit that many have already reached that limit. Although "i the past two weeks have seen a rise, due to articles bought in advance, the increase is not of great significance and it is believed that all will soon return to normal prices. CANNOT BRING IN PASSENGERS Due to the fact that the Julian Alonso does not have telegraphy, it has not been able to bring in passengers. More than 200 passengers could not embark in Santo Domingo due to this inconvenience, since in response to a cable that the Julian could send to the island, it was answered that it could not bring passengers until it had wireless telegraph facilities.
