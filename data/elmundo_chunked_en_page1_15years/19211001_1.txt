Economic Commission agrees not to remove Coll Vidal as under-secretary.
Yesterday the "Economic Commission of Puerto Rico" met at the office of the Central Board, and the Chairman reported a letter from the Governor, in which he suggested that Mr. A. Coll y Vidal be removed as Under-Secretary of that body. According to our reports, Mr. Cuevas Zequeira made a motion, which was seconded by Mr. Tizo! in the sense that Mr. Coll Vidal could not be removed from that position, since he had not committed any public offense with the publication he made of a newspaper article, since he himself had not written Mr. Coil as Bub-Secretary of said Commission nor as head of the "Diario de Sesiones' del Senado, and was acting within the sphere of his rights as a free citizen, qualified to issue the expressions of his thoughts. Mr. Iglesias presented another motion to the effect that he understood that, in spite of what is said to the contrary, good relations exist between the Goberna dor and the Legislature, and the de. seos of the Economic Commission being inhibited from any predisposition with the. The motion of Mr. Iglesias was put to a vote, and was defeated, that of Mr. Cuevas Zeta, and the motion of Mr. Cuevas Zeta was defeated. Mr. Cuevas Zequeira's motion was then put to a vote, and was defeated by a unanimous vote, with Mr. Iglesias, Mr. Alonso and Mr. Tons Soto, who has been appointed to replace the late Dr. Barbosa, voting against it. f I ' I ' _ i TO THE AGENTS OF ' ■ PUERTORjGO OTEADO \ ue to the fact that this empre- ' - *a is preparing an edition of "Puerto Rico Ilustrado" in honor of Dr. Jose C, Barbosa, for Saturday, October 8 Ma Administration ryqga to . < Messieurs Agents on the island please advise by telegraph immediately on our account, the 'Number of copies you wish extra .

The Governor's backbone is not broken.
This is the opinion of The New York Herald, New York, about the current Governor of Puerto Rico. | Here is, in full, what the newspaper says: "It should be noted everywhere with pride and gratitude that Governor Reily's clear vision and diagnosis of Puerto Rico's situation has been borne out by the facts. The resolution of the new Governor and the attitude assumed toward the defenders of the independence movement seem to be bearing the fruits of victory more rapidly, perhaps, than was expected. When the new Governor arrived on the island, carrying with him the policy of the Republican Administration and Mr. Harding's views of the separatist politicians, he lost no time in informing the leaders of the party in power, and the people of the island in general, that Statehood was the only way forward, and not a comparison with a lone star, but with a lone star, but with a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star, a lone star.

POLICE SHOOT AT SMUGGLERS IN GUAYAMA Expanding on the telegram we published yesterday concerning ui" liquor smuggling in Guayama, we can report that, according to details obtained by a redactoh of ours in that city, the police pursued with gunfire the vch'culo in which the contraband was going, without getting the former to stop in its mad race, through the streets. The police followed the vehicle, and when it reached the road, the guards took an automobile, in which they pursued the fugitives. The fugitives, seeing themselves in the lion's den, and taking advantage of their lead over the police, stopped in the middle of the road and threw the "nectar of the gods", which consisted of six cases of brandy and five cases of champagne, over a precipice. The vehicle, according to our reports, was abandoned by the smugglers. The liquors were bound for San Juan, and were part of a consignment of 100 cases of liquors, which were unloaded at * * * Las Marías", coming from Santo Domingo, as reported by EL MUNDO.

The party in charge of the Legislature has just given a vote of confidence to Governor Reily, who has approved the presidency of Mr. José G. Torres, interim governor, during the absence of Mr. Antonio Barcelé, in Cuba and Washington. The vote of confidence was against the independent movement and in favor of statehood, and there was only the vote against Mr. Coll y Cuchí, speaker of the Assembly, who now appears as the child on the side of the pro-independence movement. This action means a great deal, and the New York Herald believes it to be the wish and opinion of the majority of the Puerto Rican people. I Governor Mr. Rei and should be fe licitated for his backbone integrity. Tuerto Rico is on the road to the glory and practical benefits of becoming a state of the Union".

The famous tenor Paoli could succeed 1 *| the great Caruso, idol of the Americans.
September 23, 1921, Mr. Antonio Paoli, Teatro dell'Opera, Milan, Italy. Dear compatriot: The city of New York, America's metropolis, has a vacancy, which, in my opinion, corresponds to you. The artistic world is in mourning for the loss of the brilliant singer called Enrico Caruso, and in particular the New York musical circle is eclipsed, with the disappearance of that splendorous star of art. Who is to take Caruso's place? This question is asked daily by artists, the press and the people. Many times I have felt the desire to answer: Caruso's place now belongs to a fellow countryman of mine; to a privileged son of Puerto Rico, the beautiful antique island, to a nightingale of those celestial jungles, whose name is Antonio Paoli. It would be impossible to describe the good in-! , I
It would be impossible to describe the great good that you would do to Puerto Rico if you came to these regions to demonstrate with your artistic genius, that it fell to that prodigal nature, to that piece of beloved land, the privilege of giving the world the outstanding figure of lyrical art, Antonio Paoli, to be the legitimate heir of the brilliant position he occupied in the theatrical scene of New York. The residence of you in New York would be, in addition to the artistic option, a great influence for this colony, and of great help to Puerto Rico in all its relations with this Nation. I consider that you would have great interest in serving your homeland with the influence of your artistic and social prestige, since almost always great men, the greater their glory, love more the corner of the earth where they had the fortune to be born. As for the economic result that your work could bring you in the city of New York, I anticipate to say that the great singers receive a higher salary in this city than in any other part of the world. My influence and my efforts are very modest, but it is with great pleasure that I offer them to you to help you reach the position that belongs to you in this city, so that you may receive a salary worthy of your brilliant faculties, and that Puerto Rico may attain the artistic glory to which it is entitled, since it is your homeland. I look forward to hearing from you, and I wish you good health, my sincere compatriot and friend, and S| 3., V. FIOL RAMOS.
