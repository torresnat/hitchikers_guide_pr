The Unionist delegation invited President Harding to visit the island.
The Ledo. Tizol, a member of the Unionist delegation which returned two days ago from the United States, spoke to one of our editors yesterday about the attitude of "El Tiempo" in trying to disprove the fact that the Unionist delegation was not there to visit President Harding. What happened," Mr. Tizol told us, "was that when we went to visit President Harding. Tizol- was that when we came down from Casa Blan ca, we were assaulted by the representatives of the most important American newspapers, eager to know about our impre alones, because, (by the way) all the American press shows a very lively interest in the affairs of Tuerto Rico, I believe in favor of our cause, including a great part of our cause, including a great part of the American press, which has just received a GENUINE GERMAN NEO SALVARSAN manufactured by FARBWERKE vorm MEISTER LUCIUS &.

We were notified one Saturday morning that the President was in readiness to receive us, and we set out to go; certainly we were not all assembled at that time, but at last we got together and went to see him at about twelve o'clock. They spoke with him, mainly Cuevas Zeqr.eira and Esteves, who raised the situation with him and put the case in his hands for solution, as I have already told you on a previous occasion. The figure of the President is extremely sympathetic," Tizol continued. He told us that he and the other officials of the Administration were interested in the future of Puerto Bico and were anxious that interests should be harmonized and the situation settled. On our observing," said Tizol, "that the President showed a desire to visit the island, we formally extended to him an invitation to do so, and after thanking us he promised (Oeatlafia "a la pg. S.)

the three political parties of Puerto Rico. The Socialists, Republicans and Unionists all endorsed my candidacy to President Harding, and I would like to state, first of all, that Mr. Roberto H. Todd, has been the one who most persistently and unselfishly recommended my humble name to President Harding. -Did you not also receive the endorsement of Governor Reily? Our interlocutor did not answer this question. He merely conjectured and glanced at the books that materially covered the walls of the room. .... (Centínfia en 1" pá. 3a.)
